According to Omni Air InternationalÕs Director of Safety, the accident captain stated in his irregularity report that at approximately 1330z while at 36,000 feet, they encountered moderate turbulence. He said that the ride had been smooth for the whole flight and that the seatbelt sign had been off. There was some thunderstorm activity in the area, and the airplaneÕs radar indicated the presence of a cell about 30 miles south of the airplaneÕs position, with tops that reached about 28,000  to 30,000 feet. The pilot said that they saw some towering cumulus clouds in the area, but that the ride still continued to be smooth. The lead flight attendant was on the flight deck, and they encountered an area of higher clouds, but the radar did not indicate any activity. The Captain said that within a few seconds they felt an initial bump, followed by moderate turbulence. The seatbelt sign was then turned on, and the lead flight attendant sat in the observerÕs seat. According to the Captain the turbulence lasted only a few seconds, after which the lead flight attendant left the flight deck. A few minutes later the lead flight attendant communicated with the flight deck and informed the Captain of the injured passengers and flight attendants. 



The lead flight attendant stated that about 1330Z they encountered ""bad turbulence"", which lasted about 30 seconds. She further stated that she was in the cockpit at the time, and as soon as the turbulence was gone she left the cockpit to check on everyone, at which time another flight attendant informed her that two flight attendants were ""down.""  She then communicated with the flight deck and relayed the information to the captain.



Another flight attendant stated that the flight encountered two turbulence events while the cabin crew was making preparations for the second meal service. She said that the turbulence in the first event was slight but the second event was ""drastic."" She said that the second turbulence event caused her to hit the ceiling and then her entire body descended and slammed to the floor.



The accident airplaneÕs flight data recorder (FDR) was sent to the NTSBÕs Recorder Laboratory, Washington DC, for readout, and was found to contain 14 minutes of data pertaining to the accident flight.

The descent to KMFE began, with the airplane at an airspeed of 280 knots and a descent rate of approximately 1,000 feet per minute. A line of precipitation about 5 to 10 nautical miles wide was indicated on the airplane's weather radar. The depiction was green in color from -2 to +2 degrees. The airplane entered a cloud formation about 20,000 feet mean seal level (MSL) and encountered severe turbulence for about 15 seconds. This included up and down drafts and a roll of about 30 degrees.  During the turbulence encounter a passenger, who had gotten up and went into the lavatory, sustained serious injuries. In addition, two passengers and a flight attendant not wearing their seatbelts sustained minor injuries. The descent continued to 10,000 feet MSL as cleared. At that time the lead flight attendant called the captain and notified him of injuries in the aft cabin. The captain continued to the approach and communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC) the need to land as quickly as possible for a medical emergency.



The flight data recorder was removed and secured for further analysis and the airplane was inspected for damage in accordance with Continental and Boeing maintenance manuals.  There was no damage noted and the airplane was released for further flight.",NA,"Before departure the captain briefed all crew members not to perform any services and remain in their jump seats for the duration of the flight due to the possibility of severe weather. The lead flight attendant then made a public address announcement to the passengers that due to possible bad weather there would be no service and the seat belt sign would remain on during the entire flight, stressing the need for the passengers to remain in their seats. In addition, the first officer made a similar announcement to the crew and passengers stressing the need to remain seated for their safety. While descending to the destination airport, a passenger who had gotten up and went into the lavatory sustained serious injuries when the airplane encountered an area of severe turbulence.

The flight originated from John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York, at 1403. 



According to the captain's written statement, the airplane was jolted as it descended through 12,000 feet and went through a small cumulus cloud (top approximately 14,000 feet). Specifically, the airplane dropped about 20 feet instantaneously. The seatbelt sign had been illuminated since 19,000 feet (about 5 minutes prior) and there were no returns on the weather radar within 20 miles of the airplane's position. The captain had instructed the flight attendants via intercom to sit down a few minutes prior to the turbulence encounter. Within 15 seconds of encountering the jolt, the airplane was in clear air and the captain called the flight attendants to tell them it was safe to get up. He was then notified that a female passenger in seat 24C did not have her seatbelt fastened, and had fallen forward into the stowed tray table in front of her. Shortly thereafter, the captain was notified that another female passenger (seat 22C) was in an aft lavatory during the turbulence and was complaining of back pain. The flight landed uneventfully and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, who had been requested by the flightcrew, boarded the airplane at the gate. At that time, two additional passengers (seats 21E and 24E) informed EMS that they were injured. All four passengers were transported to local hospitals.



The first officer and flight attendants reported that the captain had made a passenger announcement during initial descent and prior to the turbulence encounter, emphasizing the need for passengers to take their seats and fasten their seatbelts when the seatbelt sign was illuminated. Additionally, a flight attendant made a public announcement when the seatbelt sign was illuminated. 



According to a Senior Air Safety Investigator at JetBlue, the passengers in seats 21E and 24E were released from the hospital with no fractures reported. The passenger in the lavatory suffered two spinal fractures and the passenger in 24C suffered fractures of two ribs. 



The Senior Air Safety Investigator at JetBlue further stated that review of the airplane's quick access recorder (QAR) data revealed that approximately 4 minutes elapsed from the time the airplane descended through 19,000 feet, until the time of the turbulence encounter. He added that the company's standard operating procedure is for the seatbelt sign to be activated when descending through 18,000 feet. Further review of the QAR revealed that at 1608, the airplane experienced a positive g-load of 1.98, followed by a negative g-load of -0.43 less than 1 second later. At that time, it was at an altitude of approximately 12,500 feet, near the MAZZY waypoint.

The airplane was not damaged and there were no injuries to the airline transport certificated captain, commercial certificated first officer, or 30 passengers. The sole flight attendant was seriously injured. The flight originated from CLT about 2301.



The flightcrew stated that after leveling off at 14,000 feet mean sea level (msl), both conferred and it was decided to let the flight attendant begin beverage service. The flight continued and shortly afterwards they noticed a layer of clouds 10 miles ahead and they asked the air traffic controller if they could climb to 17,000 feet msl. The controller was unable due to another aircraft at 15,000 feet msl, and the captain asked the flight attendant (F/A) if she had the beverage cart out and she replied she did. The captain informed her to suspend beverage service due to potential incoming turbulence and to be seated. The airplane entered a cloud layer and the flighcrew was advised to turn right 80 degrees towards a navigation fix, which was performed with the autopilot engaged. After completing 60 degrees of the turn, the first officer (F/O) noticed a ""small cell showing on the radar directly on aircraft path"" and turned an additional 30 degrees to avoid the cell.



The F/A stated that she began to put the beverage cart away as instructed by the captain and when she went to release the cart brake, the flight encountered turbulence which the flight crew later described as being moderate lasting approximately 15 seconds. The F/A reported she became airborne along with the cart and when she landed she heard a ÒcrunchÓ type sound. She crawled to the intercom phone and alerted the captain that she thought she broke her ankle.

On August 27, 2009, about 1603 eastern daylight time (EDT), a Boeing 717-200, N994AT, operated by Airtran Airways as flight 163, encountered convective turbulence while climbing through flight level 250 near Inverness, Florida. One flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The other two flight attendants, the two airline transport pilots, and the 81 passengers were not injured, and the airplane was not damaged. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida, destined for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Atlanta, Georgia. The scheduled passenger flight was conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121.



According to the flight crew, after departure, the airplane was assigned a heading of 350 degrees, and was cleared to climb to its cruise altitude. The flight then entered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and encountered ""very mild light chop."" There were ""no reports of turbulence from PIREPS or ATC and no cells were displayed on the radar."" The seat belt sign was illuminated. After the airplane passed through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants began their cabin service. As the airplane passed through flight level 250, still in IMC, it encountered turbulence for approximately 15 seconds. The non-flying pilot checked the airborne radar, and changed the range settings to see if the airplane had ""hit a cell."" He saw ""nothing"" on the radar. The turbulence encounter occurred approximately 60 miles north of TPA.



According to the lead flight attendant, the cabin crew consisted of three flight attendants, designated as Lead, R1, and L2. The lead attendant was working business class at the front of the cabin, and the R1 and L2 attendants were working the service cart in the aisle at the rear of the airplane. The R1 attendant was forward of the cart, and the L2 attendant was aft of the cart. At the time of the turbulence encounter, the lead attendant was in the galley, and he ""came off the floor about a foot."" He reported that the turbulence lasted about 15 to 20 seconds, that coffee was ""splashing out of the pots,"" and that beverage cans were turning over. According to the operator's incident report, during the turbulence encounter the L2 flight attendant and the service cart ""came off the floor,"" and the cart struck the flight attendant's leg.  



The turbulence subsided, and the L2 flight attendant was observed to be lying on the floor, and complaining of ""intense pain"" in her right leg. The flight attendant's leg was immobilized and a passenger who was a nurse helped her to an unused row of seats. The flight crew was notified of the injury, and informed that the injured attendant could not perform her duties. The flight crew and the dispatch department arranged for medical personnel to meet the flight in ATL. Cabin service was discontinued, and the R1 flight attendant occupied the L2 station at the tailcone door for the landing. The injuries were subsequently diagnosed as a fractured tibia and a crushed ankle.

The 1230 NWS Convective Outlook indicated that only general airmass-type convective activity was expected, and did not forecast any organized severe weather for the region.



The 1345 area forecast for northern Florida called for scattered clouds at 1,500 and 4,500 feet, broken cloud layer at 12,000 feet, with tops to 17,000 feet, broken cirrus clouds above, with scattered thunderstorms and light rain. Cumulonimbus cloud tops were forecast to reach 45,000 feet. The same forecast stated that after 2000, scattered clouds at 2,000 feet, a broken cloud layer at 12,000 feet, with widely scattered thunderstorms and light rain, were expected.



NWS information issued at 1400 depicted conditions in the immediate vicinity of the turbulence encounter that provided additional support for the generation of convective activity, including moderate to strong multicellular-type thunderstorms in lines and clusters. 



AIRMETs and SIGMETs



The NWS website stated that ""AIRMETs (AIRman's METeorological information) are issued by the Aviation Weather Center to advise of weather potentially hazardous to all aircraft but that does not meet SIGMET criteria."" The NWS stated that ""moderate turbulence"" was one of the conditions that would result in the issuance of an AIRMET, and that ""AIRMETS are also amended as necessary due to changing weather conditions or issuance/cancellation of a SIGMET."" AIRMETs are routinely issued for 6-hour periods beginning at 2245 EDT. 



The NWS website stated that a ""SIGMET (SIGnificant METeorological information) advises of weather potentially hazardous to all aircraft other than convective activity,"" and are issued for several reasons, including ""severe or extreme turbulence."" SIGMETs are typically issued for 4-hour periods. According to the NWS, ""if conditions persist beyond the forecast period, the SIGMET is updated and reissued."" 



Convective SIGMETs are issued for ""severe surface weather,"" including ""embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, and thunderstorms greater than or equal to video integrator and processor (VIP) intensity level 4 affecting 40% or more of an area at least 3000 square miles."" The NWS stated that ""any convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence,"" that they are issued hourly at 55 minutes past each hour, and are valid for up to 2 hours.



Between 1255 and 1555, the NWS issued three convective SIGMETs that overlaid the planned flight track in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter, and which forecast embedded thunderstorms, with tops above flight level 450, moving approximately south to north. At 1255, the NWS issued convective SIGMET 37E. That convective SIGMET was valid until 1455, which was about 1 hour prior to the planned departure time. At 1455, the NWS issued convective SIGMET 43E, which overlaid a portion of the area encompassed by 37E, and was valid until 1655. Convective SIGMET 43E forecast a diminishing area of embedded thunderstorms. At 1555, about 6 minutes after the flight took off, convective SIGMET 46E was issued. Convective SIGMET 46E was valid until 1755, forecast embedded thunderstorms, and included areas common to 37E and 43E.



Meteorological Conditions in Vicinity of Turbulence Encounter 



The 1600 NWS radar composite reflectivity mosaic image depicted several defined echoes associated with thunderstorms north of the departure airport, including a short but intense line at the latitude and longitude of the turbulence encounter, but below the airplane's altitude. The 1620 NWS radar summary chart depicted an extensive area of thunderstorms in the vicinity of the flight track, and also depicted the solid line of thunderstorms in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter. Weather observations from several airports in the vicinity of the encounter included the presence of thunderstorms prior to, during, and after the encounter.



Correlation of the ground-based WSR-88D with the flight path information revealed that the airplane was penetrating a line of radar echoes when the turbulence encounter occurred. The data depicted radar echoes of magnitude 20-30 dBZ (decibels) at the airplane's altitude, and echo magnitudes of 50 to 55 dBZ below the airplane. The radar data also depicted echoes that overlaid the airplane's flight path, with tops above the airplane's altitude.



Infrared satellite imagery from 1602 depicted the presence of cumulus clouds, with tops near 36,500 feet, at and around the location of the turbulence encounter. The radar and satellite imagery indicated conditions that were consistent with the airplane flying through clouds at the time of the turbulence encounter.



""Tail-end Charlie"" Phenomenon



The operator's submission to the NTSB suggested that the airplane encountered a ""Tail-end Charlie,"" which was a common-use term for the trailing (""tail-end"") cell in a line of build-ups or thunderstorms. Review of the available ground-based WSR-88D radar data revealed that a continuous line of echoes was oriented along a southwest to northeast axis. The line was translating to the north-northwest, and was expanding in length to the southwest. The line was depicted on the radar summary chart with reflectivity Levels 5 or 6, which were defined as ""intense to extreme."" The airplane penetrated the southwestern portion of the line, which was its advancing segment.





AIDS TO NAVIGATION 



The initial segment of the planned route of flight was from TPA 101 miles north to the Cross City (CTY) very high frequency omni-range navigation facility (VOR), and then northwest to WYATT intersection. Although not cited in the flight plan as waypoints, two VORs which were equipped to broadcast hazardous inflight weather advisory service (HIWAS) were located within reception range of the airplane's flight track. The St. Petersburg (PIE) VOR was located about 10 miles west of TPA, and the Gators (GVN) VOR was located about 35 miles east of CTY VOR. Review of aeronautical charts indicated that at the time of the turbulence encounter, the airplane was about 60 miles north of the PIE VOR, and about 60 miles southwest of the GNV VOR. 





COMMUNICATIONS 



According to air traffic control (ATC) radio communications documentation provided by the FAA, the flight was issued taxi clearance at 1541, and takeoff clearance at 1547. Two minutes later, the flight was handed off to the Tampa TRACON (traffic control). About 1553, the flight made initial radio contact with Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC, designated as ""ZJX"") sector R88. The turbulence encounter occurred at 1603, and the flight was handed off to ZJX sector R17 about 1 minute after that. 



According to Chapter 2, section 6 of FAA Order 7110.65R (Air Traffic Control), ""Controllers shall advise pilots of hazardous weather that may impact operations within 150 NM of their sector or area of jurisdiction. Hazardous weather information contained in HIWAS (hazardous inflight weather advisory service) broadcasts includes ... Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), Convective SIGMET (WST)...and Center Weather Advisories (CWA)."" The section also stated that ""Controllers within commissioned HIWAS areas shall broadcast a HIWAS alert on all frequencies, except emergency frequency, upon receipt of hazardous weather information. Controllers are required to disseminate data based on the operational impact on the sector or area of control jurisdiction."" 



Review of the communication transcripts revealed that none of the four ATC controllers who communicated with the flight prior to the turbulence encounter mentioned the existence of either SIGMET 43E or 46E, or broadcast a HIWAS alert, while the flight was on their frequency. 





FLIGHT RECORDERS 



The flight data recorder information was downloaded and provided to the NTSB Recorders Laboratory. The data indicated that when the airplane was climbing through an altitude of 25,300 feet, and at an airspeed of 307 knots, it experienced a rapid vertical acceleration increase that reached a peak value of approximately 2.5 g (acceleration due to gravity), and decreased to approximately 0.5 g within 1 second. The vertical acceleration values then fluctuated between 0.6 g and 1.2 g for the next 11 seconds, before they stabilized near the normal value of 1 g. During that same period, the data indicated pitch and roll excursions of approximately 5 and 20 degrees, respectively, and an airspeed decrease of approximately 15 knots. The altitude at the end of the encounter was approximately 25,800 feet.    



The acceleration sensors were installed near the airplane's center of gravity (CG). However, since an airborne airplane has freedom of motion in six degrees, the accelerations measured at the CG may not be representative of those experienced elsewhere in the airplane. Accelerations in the cockpit or the aft cabin can be significantly less than or greater than those at the CG, and can differ significantly from each other as well.  





ADDITIONAL INFORMATION





CAST, JSAT and JSIT



The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) was founded in 1998 as a joint industry -government effort to develop and apply an integrated, data-driven strategy to reduce the commercial accident fatality rate, and to improve commercial aviation safety in the United States.  The CAST processes consisted of two sequential phases; analysis and implementation. The Joint Safety Analysis Team (JSAT) identified the top safety areas by the analysis of accident and incident data, produced ""problem statements"" which identified specific safety deficiencies, and identified and prioritized intervention strategies for use by the follow-on efforts of the Joint Safety Implementation Team (JSIT). The JSITs developed the means to implement the specified safety improvements through various equipment, process, operational and regulatory changes.



Several JSAT/JSIT teams, each assigned to a specific subject matter area, were formed; the Turbulence JSAT/JSIT focused on cabin safety issues related to turbulence. The Turbulence JSAT produced a total of 21 problem statements, and identified 18 safety enhancements for implementation. 



The Turbulence JSAT developed the following three flight-crew-related problem statements and definitions:

No. 601: Flight Crew - Failure to process and interpret available, relevant data. Definition: Flight crew failure to process and interpret available, relevant data, including decisions arising from Collaborative Decision-Making.



No. 602: Failure to communicate with cabin crew/Passengers. Definition: Failure of flight crew to communicate to cabin crew and/or passengers information about impending turbulence or directions to be seated/restrained.



No. 604: Not adequately prepared for the task. Definition: Flight crew not adequately prepared with briefings, in assessment of weather factors or other information received, or not mentally prepared.



The Turbulence JSIT 's ""Detailed Implementation Plan For Cabin Injury Reduction During Turbulence"" recommended several air carrier actions, including implementing ""a policy and related SOPs for FAs to remain seated during periods of significant turbulence risk including climb and descent' and ""a policy and related SOPs permitting FAs to prioritize their duties and cabin service schedules, including the option to be seated ... prior to and during turbulence encounters to minimize unnecessary FA exposure.""



FAA Advisory Circular 



In 2005, in response to the Turbulence JSIT, the FAA issued Advisory Circular (AC) 120-88 (""Preventing Injuries Caused By Turbulence""), and issued a revision to the AC in 2006. The stated purpose of the AC was to provide ""information and practices that can be used to prevent injuries caused by turbulence,"" and it was ""intended for implementation in the operations and training of air carrier flight crews, flight attendants, aircraft dispatchers, and managers."" The AC highlighted ""the data-driven methods of the FAA and its government and industry partners in identifying practices known to be effective against injuries caused by turbulence.""



Paragraph 11 of AC 120-88 provided recommended dispatch procedures, including:



""a. Keep communication channels open full-time. 

Dispatchers can communicate with flightcrews, and flightcrews can communicate with dispatchers, before, during, and after a flight, and can be encouraged to do so whenever necessary...Communication should be encouraged by an air carrier's management to improve the flow of real-time information regarding turbulence.



b. Weather Briefings. 

Preflight weather briefings... must include forecasts of turbulence and pilot reports of turbulence ....



c. Real-time Information Sharing. 

During a flight, the pilot and dispatcher must communicate any changes in the forecast or actual turbulence conditions ... in order to pass real-time turbulence information along to other flights.""



Appendix 1 of the AC presented standard terminology for turbulence, excerpted from the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual. The terminology and definitions were very similar to those in the operator's FAM and FOM, and included: 



""Light Chop - Slight, rapid, and somewhat rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude.



Moderate Turbulence - Changes in altitude and/or attitude occur but the aircraft remains in positive control at all times. It usually causes variations in indicated airspeed. Occupants feel definite strain against seatbelts. Unsecured objects are dislodged. Food service and walking are difficult.



Severe Turbulence - Large, abrupt changes in altitude and/or attitude. Usually causes large variations in indicated airspeed. Aircraft may be momentarily out of control. Occupants are forced violently against seatbelts. Unsecured objects are tossed about. Food service and walking are impossible.""



Operator Guidance Regarding Turbulence



The operator provided crew guidance in two separate documents, one each for the cabin crew (Flight Attendant Manual; FAM) and for the flight crew (Flight Operations Manual; FOM). The guidance was consistent across the two documents.  



Section 10.0 (page EMS-37) of the then-current FAM was entitled ""Turbulence,"" and stated that ""crew communication and coordination is essential during turbulent and bumpy"" conditions, and that ""if turbulence is anticipated, the Captain will turn on the 'Fasten Seatbelt' sign and may request that Flight Attendants sit in jumpseats and fasten their seatbelts."" The FAM stated that during light turbulence, ""normal cabin duties may be accomplished."" It also stated that ""if moderate or severe turbulence is anticipated...Flight Attendants are to secure the cabin and galleys (stow carts) and check customer compliance,"" and that ""If instructed to do so, Flight Attendants are to take their seats and fasten their seat belts."" Section 10.3 (Levels of Turbulence), listed three separate turbulence levels (Light, Moderate, and Severe) and provided descriptive text to enable categorization of the turbulence levels based upon their effects in the cabin. The FAM defined severe turbulence as that in which ""unsecured objects are tossed about.""



The FOM required that the flight crew provide a preflight briefing to the cabin crew prior to each flight. The stated purpose of the briefing was to ""pass pertinent information from the flight deck crew to the cabin crew in a timely manner."" If turbulence was anticipated or expected, the flight crew was required to provide that information, as well as its ""recommendations or instructions on conduct of cabin service relative to weather conditions,"" to the cabin crew. The FOM provided for the option of a ""standard crew briefing,"" which was to be used when only limited time for the briefing was available. If turbulence was not expected, or not expected to adversely affect cabin service, the flight crew could use the phrase ""standard briefing,"" and forego a specific mention of turbulence. The FOM also stated that the flight crew was to communicate with the cabin crew during flight, if the expected or encountered turbulence warranted that the cabin crew should be or remain seated. The FOM did not require the flight crew to provide the cabin crew with an estimate of the time available before the onset of any anticipated turbulence.



The JSAT substantiating data revealed that turbulence was a principal cause of flight attendant injuries, and the JSAT/JSIT demonstrated that emphasis on cabin service can adversely affect cabin safety. Comparison of the FAM and FOM contents with the information in the Turbulence JSIT and JSAT reports, and AC 120-88, revealed that the operator's guidance incorporated some, but not all, of the recent industry and FAA material regarding turbulence hazard mitigation. The operator's procedures placed the bulk of the communication and decision-making responsibility with the flight crew, while the recent mitigation strategies emphasized a more mutual approach, with a strong emphasis on inter-crew communication. In its accident submission to the NTSB, the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA, which represented the cabin crew) recommended that the FAM be modified to provide greater autonomy for the flight attendants when it came to decisions about when to provide service, when to remain in or re-take their seats, and task prioritization in the event of turbulence. The decreased emphasis on cabin service, as advocated by the AFA, is congruent with the JSIT recommended actions.



No records or statements that indicated that a preflight briefing was conducted, or that any specific preflight information regarding turbulence was provided by the flight crew to the cabin crew, were provided to the investigation. During the flight, the flight crew did not advise or instruct the cabin crew to remain seated, nor did they advise the cabin crew of any anticipated turbulence.



Cabin and Flight Crew Statements



The lead flight attendant filed a ""Cabin Service Report"" with the operator, which included a narrative of the turbulence encounter. The narrative stated that ""there was only light turbulence"" prior to the event, and that ""about 5 minutes"" after the attendants had moved the cabin service cart to the aft end of the airplane, the airplane ""hit severe clear-air turbulence"" which lasted for ""15-20"" seconds. An incident report signed by the injured flight attendant stated that ""during service jet hit turbulence,"" that the ""service cart and [flight attendant] came off the ground,"" and that the cart struck the flight attendant's right leg in the ""medial shin area.""



The captain's written account of the event stated that the airplane was in instrument meteorological conditions when it ""encountered unexpected and unforeseen moderate turbulence for a few seconds."" The first officer provided a more detailed account. He stated that the airplane was ""in the clouds... since takeoff,"" and that neither air traffic control (ATC) nor any aircraft preceding the event airplane reported any ""adverse weather."" He also noted that ""no adverse weather [was] depicted on the onboard weather radar,"" but he did not specify the range or tilt settings in use at the time. He stated that captain was the pilot flying, and that the seatbelt sign was on, but that it ""likely"" would have been off if the airplane was in cruise flight at the time. The first officer stated that he ""did not know what caused"" the turbulence, but offered that the airplane might ""have flown over a dissipating cell below our altitude that was not detectable"" by the ATC or airplane radar systems. 



None of the cabin or flight crew statements indicated whether there was a pre-flight briefing, or whether the potential for in-flight turbulence was discussed.



Operator's Dispatch Department Information



The flight dispatch department was responsible for providing the flight crew with appropriate flight planning information, and for monitoring the progress of the flight. Per CFR 121.601, before and during the flight, the department ""shall provide the pilot in command any additional available information of meteorological conditions...that may affect the safety of the flight.""



The hardcopy document of weather information that was provided to the flight crew by the operator's dispatch department was issued at 1356, about two hours before the turbulence encounter. The document included surface observations, forecasts, and notices to airmen for the departure, enroute, and destination airports. It also included pilot reports and wind and temperature aloft forecast data for the route, as well as AIRMET and convective SIGMET information. The weather section included convective SIGMET 37E, which was only valid until 1 hour before the planned departure time. The document did not include convective SIGMET 43E (issued 1 hour prior to the planned departure time, and which overlaid the flight track and turbulence encounter location) or SIGMET 46E (issued 6 minutes after the actual departure time, and which also overlaid the turbulence encounter location). 



There was no indication that convective SIGMET 43E, or the pertinent information it contained, was issued to the flight crew. No weather-related documents, products, or advisories, other than the original dispatch document, were provided to the crew by the operator. In addition, there were no indications that the crew received updated weather-related advisories from other sources. 



Post Event Modifications by the Operator



In late March 2010, the operator's Manager of In-Flight Standards issued a ""Must Read"" interoffice memo addressed to all the operator's flight attendants. The stated subject was ""In-Flight Turbulence."" The first sentence of the memo stated that ""Although turbulence...is a routine occurrence, Flight Attendants must always be mindful of their safety..."" The remainder of the memo discussed the general cabin crew procedures for expected or encountered turbulence, and the contents were consistent with the guidance provided in the FAM. 



According to the manager of the dispatch training program, as a result of the lessons learned from the turbulence event, the operator initiated implementation of two modifications to the information provided to flight crews by dispatch. Final implementation of those changes was still pending as of February 2011.  



One planned modification was to provide flight crews with quantitative forecast turbulence levels associated with specific navigational fixes. The operator purchased a subscription for forecast turbulence data from a commercial weather services vendor. The intensity of the forecast turbulence was to be divided into seven levels, with each level assigned a numerical value from ""1"" to ""7."" The flight planning system will be modified to incorporate the forecast turbulence data (numeric intensity value, geographic location and valid time period), and output it on the flight crew dispatch documents, with a forecast turbulence level for each navigation fix in the flight plan. 



The other planned modification was the incorporation of graphical weather information into the dispatch paperwork. AIRMET and SIGMET data were output in graphical format and overlaid on the charts that depicted the planned flight route, to enable crewmembers to readily discern the intersection or relative proximity of the two. Flight crew procedures will be changed, and crews will be advised to contact dispatch for an expanded briefing if the route of flight intersects any AIRMET or SIGMET volume.",NA,"The scheduled passenger flight was climbing through 25,000 feet when it encountered convective turbulence in daytime instrument meteorological conditions. A flight attendant, who was servicing the aft cabin, sustained leg and ankle fractures when her service cart became airborne and struck her in the leg. Both the flight and cabin crew members stated that the turbulence was unexpected. The National Weather Service (NWS) had issued multiple, sequential warnings of significant meteorological activity (SIGMETs) regarding the potential for thunderstorms and turbulence along the flight's planned route. The operator's dispatch department provided the flightcrew with a SIGMET that was valid until about one hour before the scheduled departure time. Contrary to operator and regulatory requirements, the dispatch department did not provide the flight crew with updated, current information, which included two new SIGMETs, one of which was issued an hour before the scheduled departure time, and all of which were similar in content and coverage area. The flight crew did not check with dispatch to determine whether any SIGMETS were current for the planned departure time. None of the air traffic controllers who handled the flight prior to the event relayed any hazardous weather information to the flight, despite their requirement to do so. 



Correlation of meteorological and flight path data indicated that the turbulence encounter occurred when the airplane penetrated a continuous line of thunderstorms that was present in the SIGMET coverage area. Strong radar echoes, indicative of potential turbulence, were detected below the airplane's altitude by ground-based weather radar. Review of the operator's flight and cabin crew guidance revealed that the procedures incorporated some of the latest industry strategies for mitigating turbulence hazards, but did not provide the flight attendants with the recommended level of autonomy when it came to decisions about when to provide service, or how to prioritize tasks, in the event of turbulence. Although hindered by the failure of the dispatch department to provide them with current SIGMETs, given the previous SIGMET and forecast for significant thunderstorms along the route, and atmospheric activity that was likely readily detectable by the airplane's onboard weather radar, the flightcrew could have anticipated the turbulence, and the flight attendants could have either been instructed to remain seated, or been provided with sufficient information to decide on their own, until the airplane was clear of the hazard area.","The flight crew's encounter with convective turbulence. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the operator's dispatch department to provide the flightcrew with current adverse weather information along the planned route of flight. was the failure of the flightcrew to provide relevant forecast information to the cabin crew, and their failure to detect and avoid the existing convective conditions.","FINAL","ACCIDENT","27-Aug-09","163, 250, 307, 350, 717, 1603, 2000, 2009, 4500, 10000, 12000, 17000, 25000, 25300, 25800, 36500, 45000","2000"

On November 18, 2009, about 1930 Eastern Standard Time (EST), N209UA, a Boeing 777-200, registered to and operated by United Airlines Inc., as a Title 14 CFR Part 121 domestic passenger flight, encountered turbulence in the vicinity of New Market, West Virginia. The flight was en route from Chicago, Illinois, to Dulles International Airport, Sterling, Virginia. The airline transport-rated captain, first officer, 7 flight attendants, and 189 passengers were not injured. One flight attendant received minor injuries and a passenger received a serious injury. The flight originated from O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois, about 1819 Central Standard Time.



According to the captain, who was the pilot flying at the time of the accident, there were no reports of turbulence or significant weather from other aircraft in the vicinity or from air traffic control, nor had United Flight Dispatch informed him of any airman meteorological information (airmets), or significant meteorological information (sigmets). He added that there were also no Òwatch boxesÓ that warned of possible adverse weather. The radar was on and tilted down one degree at the 40 mile range, when suddenly the airplane skimmed the top or went through a cloud at mach 0.84, while in cruise flight at FL310. He further stated that the turbulence was moderate and that it lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. According to the captain, at the same time the turbulence occurred, there was an overspeed warning and the autopilot tripped off. He said he immediately took manual control of the situation and turned on the seat belt sign in the cabin, which had previously been off because conditions had been smooth. He said that at no time was the airplane out of control, and that after the turbulence, conditions immediately became smooth. He said he later learned that there was an injury in the passenger cabin and that he informed Washington Air Route traffic Control Center. The flight proceeded and otherwise landed uneventfully at Dulles International Airport.



The first officer stated that the weather radar was operating while in cruise flight at FL310 and that no radar returns were observed along their route, adding that the flight was Òin the clear, well above any cloud tops.Ó He further stated that while seated he experienced a sudden jolt of moderate turbulence, followed by the overspeed warning alarm during which the autopilot tripped off. He said at the time that the airplane was in instrument meteorological conditions and there was considerable ÒSt. ElmoÕs FireÓ, which lasted 10 to 20 seconds. He said he then called back to the cabin and asked if everyone was Òall rightÓ, and that the lead flight attendant told him that he would check the condition of everyone and will let the flight deck know if there were injuries. He then communicated with FAA Air Route Traffic Control to let them know about the turbulence. The first officer said that a few minutes later while in the descent to land they were informed that a passenger and flight attendant had been hurt, and he sent a Òquick noteÓ to the dispatcher requesting paramedics when the flight arrive at the gate.



One flight attendant, who had been standing in the rear galley when the turbulence occurred noted seeing a passenger Òrise up and down then fall to the floorÓ while walking by the lavatory. Another flight attendant stated that she had fallen to her knees during the turbulence encounter, and received minor injuries, adding that the turbulence was of a short duration but had been very extreme. After the turbulence ceased, a flight attendant attended to the fallen passenger who was found to have received a serious injury. The lead flight attendant then informed the flight deck that one passenger had been injured and was in need of emergency medical care.



FLIGHT RECORDERS



The airplaneÕs flight data recorder was recovered and sent to the NTSBÕs Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC for readout. The recorder was found to contain 53 hours of data. The data indicated that while the aircraft was level at 31,000 feet, vertical acceleration changed from about 1.25 gÕs to about -0.5 gÕs in less than one second, and then abruptly became 2.0 gÕs within a few seconds, before reducing to minor oscillations varying 1.25 gÕs and 0.75 gÕs which lasted for about 15 seconds. The duration of the turbulence encounter was about 20 seconds from the first disturbance until the last. In addition, the recorder data showed that the autopilot had been engaged prior to encountering turbulence and that it was disconnected when the force on the aircraft first reached about -0.5 gÕs. 



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



As part of the investigation, the NTSB conducted a meteorological study to assess weather conditions in the area where the flight encountered turbulence. It was noted that the National Weather ServiceÕs Radar Summary for 1918 EST, depicted an extensive area of rain showers over the region with a few radar echo tops between 31,000 feet and 48,000 feet. In addition the regional radar composite imagery showed that between 1910 and 1940 EST there was a small area of reflectivity between 5 and 25 decibels in the area of the turbulence encounter.",NA,"Prior to and after the turbulence encounter the captain reported smooth air while level at FL310. There were no reported sigmets, airmets, or pilot reports issued, nor were there Òwatch boxesÓ that warned of adverse weather. The onboard weather radar was functioning when suddenly the airplane went through a cloud at Mach 0.84 and encountered moderate turbulence for about 10 to 15 seconds. He said that there was an overspeed warning alarm and he immediately took over manual control of the airplane maintaining control, and activated the seat belt warning sign which had previously been off, since the flight had been smooth.  The first officer statement was consistent with the captainÕs and in addition he reported seeing Òconsiderable St. ElmoÕs FireÓ throughout the duration of the turbulence.

Following the encounter, a medical emergency was declared and the flight diverted to Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (YUL), Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and landed uneventfully.  



According to the captain, who was the nonflying pilot at the time, the seat belt sign had been off for approximately 30 minutes prior to the turbulence encounter, which he described as ""unexpected and extremely violent"".   The airspeed quickly increased into the overspeed range and the first officer attempted to control the airspeed by retarding the throttles.  The airspeed decayed rapidly then increased immediately back into the overspeed range with a maximum speed of about .875 mach.  He stated that the altitude deviations appeared to be plus or minus 80 to 100 feet and the autopilot remained engaged during the entire encounter.   



INJURIES



One flight attendant suffered a fractured leg and one passenger suffered a fractured ankle.    



DAMAGE TO AIRPLANE



The airplane suffered no damage during the event.



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



A review of the weather briefing provided to the accident flight crew by company Flight Dispatch contained relevant SIGMETs along the  proposed route of flight. The package was not found to be missing any pertinent published information that could have alerted the flight crew to an enroute severe turbulence encounter over Greenland.



Analysis of the calculated winds indicated that the airplane encountered a downdraft on the order of 13 feet/sec followed sharply by an updraft of approximately 24 feet/sec. Analysis of the surrounding atmosphere indicated the presence of an icecap wave instability that was capable of producing rapidly changing vertical winds on the order of 20 feet per second, which could result in conditions conducive to severe turbulence.  



FLIGHT RECORDERS



The FDR data show a significant decrease in normal load factor (minimum of 0.33 gÕs) immediately followed by a significant increase (maximum of 2.08 gÕs). The disturbance spanned approximately 2 seconds while the airplane was cruising with the autopilot engaged at approximately FL330.

On June 28, 2010, approximately 1752 central daylight time, N601DW, an Embraer EMB-145LR, doing buisness as American Eagle flight 3224, encountered severe turbulence while in cruise flight at approximately 38,000 feet over Pioneer, Louisiana. The captain declared an emergency and landed without incident at East Texas Regional Airport (GGG), Longview, Texas, at 1824. The captain and the first officer were not injured, and the one flight attendant was seriously injured. Of the 42 passengers on board; one was seriously injured and three sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by American Eagle Airlines, Incorporated, Fort Worth, Texas. An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight that departed Piedmont Triad International Airport (GSO), Greensboro, North Carolina, at 1605, and was destined for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the scheduled passenger flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121.



In a written statement, the captain said that 10 minutes prior to entering the clouds he made a public announcement to the passengers and also a separate call to the flight attendant about the possibility of turbulence. The seat belt sign was turned on. He stated, ""For about 10 minutes while flying in the clouds it was surprisingly smooth with not even light chop. There were no returns on the radar until about 20 seconds before the event. A very small red return was observed about 5 miles in front at our 12:30 position. Using tilt and range adjustments we were evaluating the return and discussing our actions. The event then occurred before any evasive action could be made. The event lasted less than 10 seconds and consisted of moderate rain with a strong updraft followed by one instance of a severe downdraft. The autopilot disengaged and I assumed control by hand flying the aircraft."" The captain estimated they were out of the clouds in less than 10 seconds and returned to visual meteorological conditions. He said they had gained about 880 feet in altitude during the event and informed air traffic control that they were returning to their assigned altitude. Shortly after, the flight attendant called on the interphone and said that she and one other passenger were injured. The flight attendant, who was assisting an elderly passenger in the lavatory, stated she could not walk and the passenger was bleeding from the mouth. The captain immediately declared an emergency with air traffic control (ATC) and diverted to Longview, Texas, and landed without further incident.



In an interview, the captain reported that when he saw the small red return (less than a _-inch wide) on the radar, he zoomed in and was tilting the radar antenna to get a better reading on the cell. The radar was on manual gain and he felt that they were going to fly over the top of it.  The cell was 5 miles directly in front of them or 30 seconds away.  Shortly after, they encountered rain and the strong downdraft, which threw them up into their seatbelts. The captain stated that if he saw the cell at least 5 minutes beforehand he would have asked for a deviation since American EagleÕs policy was to avoid cells by 20 miles.



The first officer provided a similar account of the accident. He stated that the radar, which was tilted down 5 degrees on variable gain, depicted an area of green precipitation in front of them and they were flying in and out of clouds. He then observed a red return on the radar about 2-3 miles in front of them, less than 20 seconds away. Before he and the captain could make a decision to deviate, they entered the clouds and it was smooth. Then it began to rain rapidly followed by a sudden gain in altitude and then a sudden drop in altitude. The entire event lasted less than 10 seconds.



The company also reported that at the time of the turbulence encounter, the autopilot disengaged and the captain immediately assumed control of the aircraft. After the event, the crew noticed they also lost the primary flight display (PFD) and multi-function display (MFD) on the first officer's panel and noticed an electrical smell in the cockpit.  Once on the ground and after everyone had been assisted, the captain made an entry in the aircraft maintenance log regarding the severe turbulence event and the subsequent electrical smell. The airplane was examined and only a few burnt out bulbs were noted in the avionics panel; however, no structural damage was noted.  The airplane was returned to service. 



PILOT INFORMATION



The captain, age 60, held an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate for airplane multi-engine land and was type-rated in the EMB-145, SF-340, and ATR 42/72 airplanes. His last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) First Class medical certificate was issued on March 17, 2010. He reported a total of 10,567 flight hours. 

 

The first officer, age 31, held a commercial pilot certificate for airplane multi-engine land. His last FAA First Class medical certificate was issued on August 10, 2009. He reported a total flight time of 3,041 hours.



METEOROLOGIAL INFORMATION 



The National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart issued at 1900 on the evening of the accident depicted a stationary front extending from Kentucky south-westward through western Tennessee, central Arkansas, and through the Dallas/Fort Worth area into central Texas. South of the front in the Louisiana/Mississippi region, surface models indicated winds were light (generally less than 10 knots) and variable; however, a southerly to easterly flow was evident. Several stations in the vicinity of the accident site reported more northeasterly flow at the surface. Sky conditions were clear to partly cloudy in the region, and temperatures were in the mid-70¡s to mid-80¡s Fahrenheit (F). Dew point temperatures north of the Gulf Coast were in the low to mid-70¡s F.

 

At 1748:43, the Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR)-88D Level-II base reflectivity ""super resolution"" imagery from Jackson, Mississippi, located approximately 80 miles east-southeast of the accident site, identified a discrete ""cell"" of strong reflectivity values (+50 dBZ) coincident with the airplane's position at the time of the turbulence event. As the airplane approached from the east, reflectivity values increased from ""light"" intensities (less than 25 dBZ) to more moderate intensities (45 dBZ) several minutes prior to the accident. 



Airmen's meteorological (AIRMET) information issued and active for the accident time and location indicated no significant turbulence, icing or IFR conditions expected outside of convective activity. Between 1555 (approximately 2 hours before the accident) and 1755 (approximate accident time) there were nine convective significant meteorological (SIGMETs) information issued for the region. At the time of the accident, convective SIGMET 90C was active and advised of thunderstorms moving slowly with tops above 45,000 feet near the accident site.



A review of recorded data from the Weather and Radar Processors (WARP) at Fort Worth Center and Memphis Center showed that moderate to extreme intensity precipitation existed ahead of the airplane for an extended period. When interviewed, both controllers and supervisors stated that they did not recall seeing any displayed precipitation in the accident location, although they did recall seeing precipitation in other locations around the area. Review of display settings in use by the controllers showed no reason that the weather would not have been displayed, and there was no indication of a WARP or radar display system malfunction.



COMMUNICATIONS



According to FAA Order 7110.65, paragraph 2-6-4, ""Weather and Chaff Services"" , controllers are required to provide the following services (higher priority workload permitting):



a. Issue pertinent information on observed/reported weather and chaff areas. When requested by the pilot, provide radar navigational guidance and/or approve deviations around weather or chaff areas. 



1. Issue weather and chaff information by defining the area of coverage in terms of azimuth (by referring to the 12-hour clock) and distance from the aircraft or by indicating the general width of the area and the area of coverage in terms of fixes or distance and direction from fixes.

 

The controller should use specific phraseology outlined in the Order to identify the location of the weather. Weather significant to the safety of aircraft includes such conditions as funnel cloud activity, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail, wind shear, micro bursts, moderate to extreme turbulence (including clear air turbulence), and light to severe icing. 



Review of ATC communications between Fort Worth Center, Memphis Center, and the flight crew revealed there were no discussions of the precipitation and thunderstorm activity ahead of the flight.  



CVR



The recording consisted of four channels of audio information; however, none of the audio was pertinent to the incident/accident investigation. The audio was consistent with the CVR being overwritten or recorded over by subsequent events.",NA,"The commercial flight was cruising at an altitude of 38,000 feet when the flight crew made a public announcement to the passengers (and a separate call to the flight attendant) that they may encounter turbulence, and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned on. The captain said they entered clouds and the flight was smooth for about 10 minutes when they noticed a very small red return (thunderstorm cell)on the radar about 5 miles in front of them. The crew did not have enough time to take evasive action and they penetrated the cell, encountering moderate rain with a strong updraft followed by one instance of a severe downdraft. The autopilot disengaged and the captain assumed control of the airplane. Shortly after, the flight attendant called on the interphone and said that she was assisting an elderly passenger in the lavatory when the upset occurred and they were both seriously injured. The captain immediately declared an emergency and landed without further incident. Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR) imagery identified a discrete cell of strong reflectivity values coincident with the airplane's position at the time of the turbulence event. A review of recorded weather data from two separate air traffic control centers handling the flight showed that moderate to extreme intensity precipitation existed ahead of the airplane for an extended period. However, the controllers did not recall seeing any displayed precipitation in the accident location, although they did recall seeing precipitation in other locations around the area.

The 2 pilots and 17 passengers were uninjured. The flight attendant sustained a serious injury and nine passengers sustained minor injuries. The airplane sustained no damage. The scheduled domestic passenger flight was conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an activated instrument flight rules flight plan was on file. The flight departed from the Lambert-St Louis International Airport (STL), near St Louis, Missouri, about 0902, and landed at the General Mitchell International Airport, near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about 1002.



Flight 1146's dispatch package included remarks for significant meteorological information  (SIGMET) VICTOR 1, valid until 1130 on November 30, 2010, to include parts of Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana bounded by a line from Marquette, Michigan, to 40 miles south southwest of Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, to Fort Wayne, Indiana, to 50 miles east of St Louis, Missouri, to Quincy, Illinois, to Iowa City, Iowa, to Marquette, Michigan, for occasional severe turbulence between 14,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL) and 24,000 feet. The SIGMET indicated that turbulence was reported by other flightcrews. Remarks indicated that turbulence conditions would continue beyond 1130. The dispatcher issued the dispatch for this flight with a cruise altitude of 13,000 feet MSL and a remark of LOWER [FLIGHT] LEVEL DUE TO TURBURLENCE.



According to the operator, air traffic control (ATC) in STL discussed the potential of turbulence with the flightcrew and stated that an altitude of 15,000 feet MSL would a better option to avoid turbulence than 13,000 feet MSL. ATC briefed that there still could be some turbulence at 15,000 feet MSL. The captain changed the flight's cruise altitude to 15,000 feet MSL. The crew announced the seat belt sign would remain on during the flight due to any potential encounter of turbulence. The seat belt sign was illuminated during the entire flight. During the beginning of the flight attendant's service, the aircraft experienced light turbulence. Halfway through the service, the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence. The flight attendant locked the cart and took a seat. The moderate turbulence dissipated after about one minute and the flight attendant completed the service. Following the completed service, the flight attendant was standing by the forward wardrobe closet and was thrown up into the ceiling and back to the floor.  She broke her nose and fractured her left wrist. After that turbulence encounter, the flightcrew called the flight attendant and asked her about her condition and the passenger's condition. She informed the flightcrew of three passengers whom had bumped their heads on the overhead passenger service units and advised the flightcrew of her injuries. Medical personnel were requested who later met the aircraft at the gate.



According to flight data recorder data, approximately 0935, while cruising at a pressure altitude of approximately 15,230 feet and with an indicated airspeed of 317 knots, the airplane's vertical acceleration increased from 1 g to 1.3 g's. The closest recorded latitude and longitude at that time of the upset was 41 degrees 55 minutes 05 seconds north and 088 degrees 18 minutes 46 seconds west. About 0.25 seconds later, the vertical acceleration decreased to -1.2 g's. About 0.63 seconds later, the vertical acceleration increased to 1.8 g's. About one second later, the vertical acceleration decreased to 0.4 g's. During the upset, the pressure altitude increased to a maximum of 15,407 feet and the indicated airspeed increased to 329 knots. Approximately 15 seconds later, the vertical acceleration settled back to 1 g.



A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector confirmed that all passenger seat belts were fastened. A seated five foot nine inch passenger was observed to have a six-inch gap between the overhead passenger service unit and the passenger's head. Three of the passenger service units sustained damage consistent with the passenger's head impacting the units. None of the passenger lap belt restraints had failed. According to the operator, nine passengers reported minor injuries.



Subsequent to the accident, the operator published an article on turbulence in the airline's quarterly safety newsletter for all employees. In reference to the accident, the operator produced a memorandum on turbulence and the accident event, which was focused on their flight operations personnel.",NA,"The flight's dispatch package included a current significant meteorological warning for occasional severe turbulence between 14,000 and 24,000 feet mean sea level (msl).

Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that was destined for Honolulu International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii. 



According to Hawaiian Airlines, while on climb-out shortly after departure, the flight experienced four ÒjoltsÓ of turbulence, characterized as moderate in intensity. The captain reported clear skies, with thunderstorms in the area. The captain further reported that the seatbelt sign was illuminated in the cabin, and the passengers were in their seat. The two flight attendants who were injured were in the aft cabin, preparing a beverage cart.



The flight data recorder (FDR) was secured and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board laboratory for readout. According to the FDR data, approximately 8 minutes after takeoff, as the airplane was about to pass through 19,000 feet, the airplane experienced perturbations in the acceleration parameters. The vertical acceleration parameter increased to +1.59 gÕs and within 2 seconds decreased to +0.66 gÕs. Vertical acceleration increased again to record a maximum value of +1.75 gÕs and then decreased to record a minimum value of +0.05 gÕs 2 seconds later.

One passenger received minor injuries and one flight attendant received serious injuries. The remaining 183 passengers, 3 flight attendants, and the two airline transport pilots were not injured. The airplane, which was being operated by Delta Air Lines as Flight 1557, was not damaged. The 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic air carrier flight, which departed Salt Lake City, Utah, at 2154 mountain standard time, was en route to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport at the time of the event, but light rain and surface winds gusting to over 20 knots had been moving through the area most of the afternoon and evening. 



The NTSB Investigator-In-Charge determined that when the flight was about 45 minutes from Seattle, the Seattle Center controller advised the crew of a PIREP (pilot report of actual weather conditions) that indicated they should expect light to moderate chop while in the descent between Flight Level 200 and 16,000 feet. The Captain therefore informed the flight attendants that they should anticipate a bumpy descent, and that they should finish up their duties early, as the initial and final chimes would be given earlier than the normal 20 and 10 minutes out. When the crew began the descent from Flight Level 350, the Captain, who was the non-flying pilot, turned on the seatbelt sign and made the announcement for the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for arrival. When the airplane was descending through Flight Level 260, the Captain gave the final (2 bell) chime, and advised the flight attendants to finish securing the cabin and then to take their seats. As the airplane was descending through Flight Level 250, the First Officer, who was the flying pilot, initiated a speed reduction to turbulent air penetration speed. About one minute later, as the airplane was passing through a cloud layer while descending through Flight Level 240 (4,000 feet higher than the parameters defined in the PIREP) the airplane suddenly encountered moderate turbulence that lasted for about 30 seconds.



At the time of the encounter, three flight attendants and one passenger were not yet in their seats. The flight attendants were completing their duties related to securing the cabin for landing, and the passenger was returning from the lavatory. Two of the flight attendants and the standing passenger were thrown to the floor by the abrupt movement of the airplane. One of the flight attendants, who was just finishing the final public address announcement from a station near the aft galley, was thrown to the floor in a manner that resulted in fractures to the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones in her right foot.

Four flight attendants were injured; two flight attendants sustained minor injuries, while two flight attendants sustained serious injuries. There were no injuries to the other 227 passengers and crew, and the airplane was not damaged. The scheduled international passenger flight originated from Narita International Airport, Narita Japan and was en route to Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121.  



The flight crew reported that as the airplane was climbing, they observed a small weather build up in front of them. They requested a deviation around the weather, but ATC informed them to standby. The first officer reported that when the flight crew received the clearance to turn the airplane was already in the weather. At about 24,000 feet, the airplane encountered moderate then severe turbulence for about 11 seconds. Although the seatbelt signs were still illuminated from takeoff, the flight attendants were working in the cabin at the time of the occurrence.  



During the turbulence encounter, both the number 2 and number 3 flight attendants received fractured ankles. The number 2 flight attendant was working in the aft galley when she was thrown to the floor of the airplane, landing hard on her right hand and the outside of her right ankle. The number 3 flight attendant was washing her hands in the 4R lavatory when she could not maintain balance and fell, striking her right foot.



The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recorders division for data analysis. According to the DFDR data, the event occurred at 6:58:38; at this time, the airplane was at a pressure altitude of about 24,000 feet, with a speed of 336 KIAS.  During the event, the vertical acceleration went from 2.2GÕs to 0.6913GÕs within 1 second, to a minimum G of 0.496 about 5 seconds after the 2.2G maximum.  



A weather study conducted by a NTSB meteorologist revealed a frontal wave over the Japanese coast with a warm front extending eastward in the vicinity of the turbulence encountered; developing gale force winds were expected.

On May 9, at 0406 CDT, an Airbus A319-131, N801UA, flew through an area of convective turbulence.  During the turbulence encounter one flight attendant was seriously injured.  None of the other two flight attendants, two pilots, or 120 passengers were injured, and the airplane was undamaged.  The airplane was registered to and operated by United Airlines under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 and the flight was designated as a passenger-carrying flight. The flight was operating on an IFR flight rules flight plan.  The flight originated at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona, and landed uneventfully at O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Chicago, Illinois.



According to the operator and the pilots, the flight departed PHX for ORD at 23:51 PST on Sunday, May 8, 2011.  The first officer was the pilot flying. Takeoff and climb were reported as normal and no adverse weather was forecast for the route.  The seatbelt sign was turned off at FL320, approximately 20 minutes after takeoff.  The airplane leveled off at a final cruise altitude of 37,000' and the ride was smooth up until the turbulence encounter.  There was no adverse weather along the route visible on radar.  The captain's navigation/radar display was set to a 40 nm range and the first officer's was set to 160 nm.  The radar tilt was set to minus 0.5¡.  There were no weather updates from Air Traffic Control (ATC), no pilot reports (PIREPS), and there was no traffic along the same route in front of this flight.  Approximately 30 minutes prior to initial decent, the captain left the cockpit for a bathroom break.  At that time, a flight attendant entered the cockpit, in accordance with the operator's two-person policy. 



During the captain's break, when the aircraft was approximately about 7 nm north northwest of Chillicothe, MO, the airplane encountered turbulence which caused sudden altitude changes (both positive and negative), coupled with rolling moments.  The first officer then disengaged the autothrottles and reduced thrust to slow the airplane down.  He then disengaged the autopilot and countered the rolling moment.  Shortly thereafter he applied forward yoke to counter the airplanes ascent. The altituded peaked at about 38,000 feet, and a recovery to 37,000 was accomplished.  All passengers were seated at the time and there were no passenger injuries.  The captain was able to secure himself in the forward cabin crew jumpseat.  The flight attendant in the cockpit was thrown off his feet.  A flight attendant in the forward galley secured herself under the galley counter.  A flight attendant in the aft galley area hit her head on the ceiling and landed on the floor and was seriously injured.  The pilots stated that the turbulence lasted approximately 30 seconds and then the ride returned to smooth conditions.  The captain returned to the cockpit and the crew communicated with ATC, company dispatch and obtained updates on the injured flight attendant's condition.  A doctor and nurse practitioner attended to the injured flight attendant in the aft galley.  The flight continued to Chicago for a normal approach and landing.  



INJURIES:



The aft flight attendant suffered a compression fracture of the L1 vertebrae.



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION:



According to recorded weather radar data, at the time of the event a stationary weather front associated with a low pressure system to the west stretched eastward across central Missouri.  The stationary front acted as a lifting mechanism to help thunderstorms to form in the area overnight.  Also, cooler upper air temperatures existed in the area, which also helped thunderstorm formation.



Recorded ground weather radar information revealed that the flight was probably passing over or through the extreme top of a rapidly developing area of convective weather at 0406 CDT, the time of the turbulence encounter.  The first lightning discharge associated with this developing cell occurred 25 seconds after the airplane first encountered turbulence, approximately 6 nautical miles to the left of the flight's ground track.  Radar reflectivity indicated that the precipitation rate at the time was light to moderate.



FLIGHT RECORDERS:



According to the flight data recorder, 0405:46, as the aircraft was  cruising at an altitude of about 37,000 feet and 262 knots, there were perturbations recorded in various parameters which lasted around 30 seconds. During that time, the aircraft roll parameter began oscillating and measured a maximum +15 degrees of right roll followed by -10 degrees of left roll 2 seconds later and some slight pitch changes.  The acceleration parameters fluctuated over the time period of the disturbance with the vertical acceleration parameter reaching a maximum value of 1.84g's and, 2 seconds later, a minimum vertical acceleration value of -.36g's as well as a minimum lateral acceleration value of .28 g's. 



The Autopilot 2 parameter transitions from engaged to disengaged at 0406:09. At 0406:33, the Autothrottle System (ATS) Active parameter becomes not active for 5 seconds and at 0407:01, both the ATS Active and ATS Engaged parameters show disengaged. At 0408:04, the autopilot and ATS parameters recorded engaged again.



A wind reconstruction based upon the FDR data performed by Airbus revealed that the aircraft sustained strong and adverse wind fluctuations on all three axes during the turbulence encounter.  A longitudinal tailwind with gusts up to 80 knots, and a right crosswind with gusts up to 40 knots existed.  Also, the upwards vertical wind gradient was about 80 knots in a 10 second timeframe.



The cockpit voice recorder was overwritten during the flight.",NA,"No adverse weather was forecast for the route.  The seatbelt sign was turned off at FL320.  The airplane leveled off at a final cruise altitude of 37,000' and the ride was smooth up until the turbulence encounter.  Both the captain's and first officer's weather radar was in use before and during the turbulence event, and there was no adverse weather along the route visible on radar.  The flight crew received no weather updates from Air Traffic Control, no pilot reports (PIREPS), and there was no traffic along the same route in front of this flight.



Evaluation of the winds using FDR data revealed that the aircraft sustained strong and adverse wind fluctuations on all three axes during the turbulence encounter, which included an upwards vertical wind gradient was about 80 knots in a 10 second timeframe.  Recorded ground weather radar information revealed that the flight was probably passing over or through the extreme top of a rapidly developing area of convective weather at the time of the turbulence encounter. Although ground based radar reflectivity data indicated that the precipitation rate within this rapidly developing cell at the time was light to moderate, detection of the cell would likely have required active adjustment of the aircraft's weather radar system. However, the flight crew was not actively manipulating the aircraft radar at the time of the event given the lack of severe weather indications.","An inadvertent encounter with unforecast convective turbulence.","FINAL","ACCIDENT","9-May-11","406, 32000, 37000, 38000","406"

On July 29, 2011, at 0558 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) a Boeing 747-422, registration N173UA, operated by United Airlines as flight 888, encountered turbulence resulting in serious injuries to a flight attendant during climbout from the Beijing International Airport, PeopleÕs Republic of China (PEK/ZBAA).  The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight destined to San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California, (SFO).  The flight was climbing through 23,000 feet in the vicinity of Tangshan, China at the time of the encounter.  The encounter resulted in serious injury to one flight attendant and minor injuries to four flight attendants. There were no injuries to the four flight crew members, 10 other flight attendants and 366 passengers which included one lap child.  The airplane was not damaged.  The Civil Aviation Authority of China delegated the investigation of the accident to the U.S. NTSB.



The crew reported that after numerous ground delays due to passenger and ATC issues, the takeoff and climbout was normal.  A small amount of clouds and rain were in the area, but the Captain reported there were no weather radar returns along the intended path. The Captain reported she used ranges from 5 to 80 miles and different antenna tilts, and noted she used the Doppler radar functions which can depict turbulence.  The Captain kept the seatbelt sign illuminated, but advised the cabin crew that they could begin service at their own discretion.  According to the flight crew, while climbing through about 22,000 to 24,000 feet the airplane encountered Òsevere turbulenceÓ and described violent pitch, altitude and airspeed excursions.  The flight attendants had begun cabin service and were working with beverage carts and other galley work, when they described a ÒviolentÓ or ÒsevereÓ jolt to the airplane.  The Captain disengaged the autopilot and attempted to maintain climb pitch attitude.  She retarded the throttle to avoid an overspeed.  Recorded flight data indicated a peak vertical acceleration of over 2 GÕs, and acceleration fluctuations continued for about 20 seconds.  After the turbulence subsided, the Captain reengaged the autopilot and advised ATC.



The purser advised the Captain that the flight attendant at door 5L was injured, with a possible broken fibula.  A passenger medical doctor on board had examined the flight attendant and advised that he thought she had a severely sprained ankle, and possibly a fibula fracture, but  that he did not see a need to immediately divert.  The flight attendant was insistent that she wished to continue the flight to the U.S. to receive medical attention.  The Captain, attending physician and injured flight attendant determined the injuries did not require immediate attention.  The Captain relayed the information to dispatch, having already advised them of the severe turbulence encounter.  The purser made arrangements to move the injured flight attendant to a business class seat, and applied a make-shift splint to her leg. They elevated her leg with pillows and applied ice to her ankle. The Captain arranged to have paramedics meet the airplane upon arrival at SFO.



INJURIES TO PERSONS



One flight attendant received a fracture to her right fibula. There were minor injuries reported to four additional flight attendants, from falls and impacts with galley service equipment, however they were able to continue cabin crew duties and safety responsibilities.  There were no injuries to the four flight deck crewmembers, 10 other cabin crewmembers, and 366 passengers which included one lap child.  



DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT



United Airlines maintenance performed a post-flight severe turbulence inspection, and reported no damage findings.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION



The captain, age 59, had worked for United Airlines since January 09, 1978.  She held an FAA Airline Transport Pilot certificate, multi-engine land, with type ratings in B737, B747-400 and NA265.  She held an FAA first class medical certificate with a limitation to wear corrective lenses.  She had about 18,500 hours total time with about 7,600 hours as pilot-in-command on the B747.



The first officer, age 62, had worked for United Airlines since March 9, 1987.  He held an Airline Transport Pilot certificate, multi-engine land, with type ratings in B747-400, B737, and B767.  He held an FAA first class medical certificate with no limitations or waivers.  He reported a total of 10,212 flight hours total time, with 8,557 hours in the B747.  



Two relief pilots were also seated in the cockpit at the time of the event. 



AIRCRAFT INFORMATION



N173UA, manufacturer serial number 24380, was a Boeing 747-422 equipped with four Pratt & Whitney 4056 engines.  The airplane had approximately 83,255 hours total time on the airframe.  Recorded data and airline records indicated no relevant maintenance issues with the airplane.  



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



An NTSB Meteorologist compiled information from the China CAAC and other sources to conduct a study of the conditions forecast and occurring in the vicinity of the accident.  Additionally, United Airlines contract weather service (ENSCO) compiled a weather study.  A cold front was producing a large area of clouds and weather along a line from eastern Mongolia, central and eastern Inner-Mongolia, into Shanxi Province.  Several areas of embedded convective cloud groups were identified along and ahead of the front, with Beijing and the area to the east of Beijing covered by convective cloud groups.  The sea port of the Bohai Sea, located 160 km or 86 miles east of Beijing was also covered by strong thunderstorms.  The Beijing upper air sounding depicted a moist low level environment with the relative humidity greater than 75 percent from the surface through 5,000 feet and between 15,000 and 32,000 feet, generally associated with an unstable air mass.  Satellite visible and infrared imagery indicated a large area of embedded convective activity around the accident location with the most activity southwest of the location moving to the northeast.  A SIGMET (significant meteorological warning) warned of embedded thunderstorms obscured and forecast with tops to 33,000 feet, south and southwest and northeast of Beijing, moving northeast at 30 kilometers per hour (18 knots).  



The preflight dispatch indicated that there was a chance of embedded thunderstorms departing the Peking FIR and that the dispatcher had increased the flightÕs taxi fuel for possible weather related departure delays. The dispatcher further indicated that there was enroute turbulence forecasted for the route.  The National Weather Service High Level Significant Weather Prognostic Chart issued for the accident time period did not predict convection over the Beijing area or the accident site, however it did include a line of isolated embedded thunderstorms with tops to 46,000 feet extending immediately east of Beijing to the Bohai Sea southwest through China along the planned route of flight.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



Not applicable",NA,"The flight crew reported a normal takeoff and climbout with a small amount of clouds and rain in the area.  The preflight weather briefing package included a forecast of convective activity including a SIGMET (significant meteorological information) for thunderstorms south of the Beijing area moving northeastward.  The crew was aware of the potential for convective activity during the climbout from Beijing, and the initial enroute segment over the Bohai Sea.  During flight, the Captain was actively using the airborne weather radar to search for convective returns, including using the Doppler functions.  Satellite imagery showed a signature termed Òtransverse bandingÓ which is indicative of thunderstorms and turbulence at altitude.  Based on the lack of weather radar returns, the Captain kept the cabin seat belt sign illuminated, but advised the cabin crew that they could begin service.  The airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of over 2 GÕs.  The activity was likely developing upwards into the flight path, and precipitation attenuation and/or radar over-scanning may have contributed to the lack of visibility of the condition, which led to the risk assessment to allow the flight attendants to begin service.



Following the turbulence encounter, the flight crew controlled the airplane appropriately to avoid an overspeed or other hazardous condition.  The flight and cabin crew consulted with a physician passenger and determined continuing the flight per the injured flight attendantÕs desire, was appropriate.","an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence likely due to radar limitations and convective weather developing upwards into the flight path.","FINAL","ACCIDENT","29-Jul-11","558, 747, 888, 2011, 5000, 22000, 23000, 24000, 32000, 33000, 46000","747"

On December 1, 2011, at 1953 Pacific standard time, a Boeing 737-7H4, N261WN, flight 1489, encountered turbulence at flight level 30,000 feet (FL300), over Yosemite National Park, California.  One flight attendant sustained serious injuries; 2 flight attendants received minor injuries; 2 pilots and 95 passengers were not injured. Southwest Airlines operated the flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, as a scheduled-passenger flight that departed Albuquerque International Sunport Airport (ABQ), Albuquerque, New Mexico. An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed. The flight was destined for Metropolitan Oakland International Airport (OAK), Oakland, California.



According to Southwest Airlines, the airplane had been at FL400 and was descending to FL300 when the flight encountered severe turbulence. All three flight attendants were not seated when the turbulence was encountered. One flight attendant was in the forward galley and the other two flight attendants were in the aft galley. When the turbulence was encountered, the  flight attendant in the forward galley was thrown up and down, and side to side with her feet leaving the cabin floor. She was able to hold onto a counter, and was eventually able to secure herself in the forward jumpseat. The two flight attendants in the aft galley were thrown around the aft galley and struck their heads and backs; they also were eventually able to secure themselves in their respective jumpseats and remained there throughout the landing. Both flight attendants were transported to the hospital via ambulance. One flight attendant was released with minor injuries. The other flight attendant was released from the hospital as well, and was informed the following day of the compression fracture of his vertebrae. There were no passengers transported to the hospital. According to statements from the flight attendants, they had been advised by the flight crew to secure the cabin early because the flight crew was expecting turbulence later in the descent. Statements from the flight crew indicated that the flight attendants had to be seated multiple times throughout the flight due to turbulence.



The captain reported that they had descended from FL400 to FL300 due to moderate turbulence. They were authorized to stop at any smooth altitude. The crew had continuous turbulence through FL320. At FL300, the ride was better, but shortly thereafter, they encountered abrupt and significant severe turbulence for approximately 10 seconds. The aircraft accelerated from .760 mach to .865 mach with vertical pitch change and associated yaw. They requested an immediate descent and checked on the status of the cabin crew and passengers. They were then advised of the injuries to the cabin crew. They declared an emergency and landed at Oakland where they were met by medical personnel.



In a statement submitted by the first officer, he reported that upon departure, they requested that the flight attendants remain seated until called. About 45 minutes after departure, the captain cleared the flight attendants to move around the cabin. The flight encountered additional turbulence, and the captain requested that the flight attendants take their seats. As the flight continued, it encountered intermittent moderate turbulence at FL400 and they requested a different altitude. The flight descended to FL300. All passengers were in their seats because the seatbelt sign was on, but the three flight attendants were not seated. The first officer could not recall the captain clearing the flight attendants from their seats.



According to statements submitted by the flight attendants, the flight crew informed the flight attendants that they were going to have them secure the cabin 35 minutes early due to projected turbulence. Shortly thereafter, the flight encountered severe turbulence. During the encounter, all flight attendants were lifted from the floor from the turbulence and unsecured service items were strewn about the galleys.



According to a statement from the dispatcher, the flight had been planned and filed to descend to FL260 prior to entering the area where the event occurred.



FLIGHT RECORDERS



The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was examined. The recording consisted of four channels of audio information; however, none of the audio was pertinent to the incident/accident investigation. The audio was consistent with the CVR being overwritten or recorded over by subsequent events. 



Data obtained from the flight data recorder (FDR) showed at 1931, the airplane was in level flight at 40,000 feet, and was experiencing vertical accelerations of about +/- 0.1g. At 1943:05, the aircraft descended to 30,000 feet. The flight management computer (FMC) computed wind speed showed a significant increase in wind speed at 30,000 feet compared to 40,000 feet. At 1953:21, when the airplane was level at 30,000 feet, it began experiencing vertical accelerations for about 13 seconds. During this period, the maximum negative and positive vertical accelerations were -0.18g and +3.52g, respectively.



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



A Senior Meteorologist reviewed weather information pertinent to the flight. Synoptic conditions were favorable for mountain wave activity over California, and the National Weather Service had issued significant meteorological information (SIGMET) and airmanÕs meteorological information (AIRMET) notices for turbulence over the region.  Additional information was included in the flight crewÕs weather document from their enhanced weather information systems (EWINS) provider (SW45), which expected severe turbulence between FL300-420. The event occurred in the region that the SIGMET and SW45 had been issued. No visual sign of the turbulence other than some lower cap or lenticular clouds over the peaks were noted, but visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at their location.",NA,"The flight was transitioning through an area of known severe turbulence. One of the flight attendants reported that the flight crew asked the cabin crew to secure the cabin early as they expected to encounter turbulence during the descent. Shortly thereafter, the airplane encountered severe turbulence and the flight attendants were thrown about the galley; one sustained a serious injury. The cockpit voice recorder contained audio that was not relevant to the flight (it was likely recorded over by subsequent events), thus it could not be conclusively determined when the flight crew asked the flight attendants to be seated because they could not recall. It is likely that the flight crewÕs request for the cabin to be secured was close to the time of the turbulence encounter, since none of the flight attendants had completed securing  the service items when the encounter occurred. Synoptic conditions were favorable for mountain wave activity and a significant meteorological information (SIGMET) advisory and airmenÕs meteorological information advisories had been issued for turbulence over the region. The flight crew also had an advisory issued from their enhanced weather information systems for severe turbulence. The event occurred in the region that the SIGMET and the advisory for severe turbulence had been issued. According to the filed flight plan, the flight was to descend before entering the advisory area for weather avoidance; however, the planned descent was not followed.","The flight crewÕs flight into known severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity.","FINAL","ACCIDENT","1-Dec-11","26000, 30000, 32000, 40000","30000"

A weather study was conducted by an NTSB meteorologist. According to the study, the High level Significant Weather Prognostic chart depicted the polar jet stream moving northeastward form Texas into Ohio then eastward into the ridge with the maximum wind of 180 knots at 35,000 feet, wind of 70 knots and greater associated with the jet stream extended from 17,000 to 51,000. A second subtropical jet stream was located south of the first jet stream.  A large area of moderate turbulence was forecasted with the polar jet stream from Missouri,Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. The chart also expected another area of moderate to severe turbulence from 25,000 to 32,000 feet with the larger area over northern Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The accident site was located within the area of moderate to severe turbulence potential. The National Weather Service (NWS) also issued multiple in-flight weather advisories current for the area including a significant meteorological (SIGMET) advisory for occasional severe turbulence between 22,000 and 30,000 feet, a Center Weather Advisory (CWA) and airman meteorological (AIRMET) advisory for moderate turbulence between 18,000 and 41,000 feet.



The Delta Meteorology Department provided the flight crew with weather documents for the intended route; the document included several weather alerts for turbulence along the route of flight, the crew also received updates en route via ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System).  The first update at 1547 CST warned of light to moderate, turbulence.  At 1559 CST the advisory was updated to include parts of Ohio and Michigan and advised to avoid altitudes form flight level 200 to 250 for moderate to severe turbulence and moderate turbulence between flight level 260 to 300.  Another ACARS message was sent at 1929 CST that indicated the area of moderate to severe turbulence had moved south and east of Detroit.",NA,"The flight crew received a preflight weather report as well as updated weather information while en route that advised them of expected turbulence near their destination airport.

According to the flight crew, they were in level cruise flight in smooth air at Flight Level 360, when the airplane experienced the turbulence encounter. Although the airplane had encountered periods of light chop earlier in the flight, it had been in completely smooth air for about 30 minutes prior to the event, and there had been no report of turbulence from the Air Route Traffic Control Center, nor had the flight crew overheard any other aircrew stating that there was anything but smooth air in the area of the encounter. Although the flight attendants were in the process of serving drinks, the passenger seatbelt sign was still on from the earlier period of choppy air. At the moment of the encounter, the airplane experienced both a momentary altitude deviation and a left roll of less than 10 degrees, both of which were corrected by the autopilot, with a slight overshoot past the wings level position. During the encounter sequence, one flight attendant was thrown back against the aft galley door, whereupon her hand hit the recyclable can door. She then immediately felt pain in the hand.

On March 20, 2012, at 0830 central daylight time, a Boeing 737-7H4, N247WN, experienced turbulence during cruise flight near Laverne, Oklahoma. Southwest Airlines operated the airplane as Flight 162 under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121. The flight crew, 2 flight attendants, and 137 passengers were not injured; 1 flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida, at 0653 eastern daylight time. The flight was destined for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona. 



According to Southwest Airlines, the airplane was in cruise flight over Laverne when it encountered three turbulence jolts. The aft galley flight attendant was injured while trying to get seated and strapped into the jump seat when another turbulence jolt occurred. The flight attendant was able to perform all required safety duties for the remainder of the flight, but reported significant back pain upon arrival to Phoenix. The flight attendant was not transported to a hospital. On March 22, the flight attendant informed the company that she had been diagnosed with a rib fracture.



In statements submitted by the flight attendants, they reported that there was a long duration of turbulence during cruise. When the turbulence diminished, the seatbelt sign was turned off. They got up and then it started to become turbulent again. As the two flight attendants in the back of the airplane attempted to secure themselves in the aft jumpseats, one of them was thrown across the galley and hit her back/ribs on an object.



FLIGHT RECORDERS



Data obtained from the flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane climbed to flight level 380 shortly after departure. About 0824, winds aloft speed calculated by the flight management computer (FMC) was about 140 knots from about 160 degrees true. For about 5 minutes around this time at flight level 380, vertical accelerations fluctuated between about 0.75g and 1.2g; lateral accelerations also fluctuated during this period, between about +/- 0.05g. At 0827, the airplane descended from flight 380 to flight level 340. Shortly after the descent began, the fluctuations in vertical and lateral accelerations decreased, fluctuating between 0.997g and 1.004g and +/- 0.01g, respectively. After 9 minutes at flight level 340, during the period of otherwise decreased vertical and lateral accelerations, the vertical acceleration varied from about 0.255g to 1.7g within a 1-second period of time at 08:38:20. About 20 minutes after this vertical acceleration encounter, the FMC calculated a decrease in winds aloft at flight level 320 to under 30 knots for about 12 minutes; during this 12-minute period the winds aloft shifted from about 160 degrees true to 340 degrees true.  



Because this was not determined to be an accident until 2 days after the event, the cockpit voice recorder information was written over by normal use.



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



A Senior Meteorologist completed a weather study. A 250-hectopascal (hPa) analysis chart obtained from the Storm Prediction Center and valid for 0700 central daylight time (CDT) identified a portion of a jet stream stretching north from central Texas into Canada. A jet streak (localized regions of very fast winds embedded within the jet stream) was identified in the vicinity of the accident location with southerly wind magnitudes greater than 150 knots. Calculations by the Rawinsonde Observation Program (RAOB) indicated the potential for significant clear-air turbulence between about 36,000 and 40,000 feet.



An AirmenÕs Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisory for moderate turbulence between FL220 and FL430 was issued at 0525 CDT and was active for the accident location at the accident time.

On May 10, 2012, at 1224 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) an Airbus 319, registration N951FR, operated by Frontier Airlines as flight 384, encountered turbulence during descent into the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (FLL).  The regularly scheduled passenger flight originated from Denver International Airport, Denver Colorado, at 0710 Mountain Standard Time (MST).  The flight was descending through 12,400 feet about 45 miles west of FLL on the JINGL1 Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) at the time of the encounter.  The encounter resulted in one serious injury and two minor injuries to the three flight attendants onboard.  There were no injuries to the two flight crew members or 138 passengers, which included one lap child.  The airplane was not damaged.



The crew reported that on initial descent into the FLL area, they noticed the Òusual Florida summertime buildupsÓ and decided to turn on the seat belt sign early, although there were no specific reports of adverse conditions.  About 20 minutes before the turbulence encounter, the Captain  (CA) briefed the Flight Attendants (FAs) that he wanted them seated early and to clean the cabin and be seated when the seat belt sign came on because he expected some turbulence.   As the airplane was descending through 25,000 feet he illuminated the seatbelt sign.  The weather radar mode was set to ÒWeather OnlyÓ and at approximately this time, both CA and FO displays were set to a range of 80 nautical miles, and remained so throughout the flight.  Radar tilt setting is not recorded.  At 1219, as the airplane descended through about 21,000 feet, ATC instructed the crew to maintain 300 knots or greater for intrail spacing.  At 1224, as the flight descended through 13,000 feet just outside of JINGL intersection the airplane encountered a Òshort moderate joltÓ as described by the crew, for about 5-10 seconds.  The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated the first officer remarking that they were about to hit a turbulent area as they neared an isolated cloud.  The crew reported that they had just emerged from another cloud when they saw the large build-up.  The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) indicated approximately a +2/-0.5 G excursion.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged and the crew made no manual inputs to the flight controls.  The crew reported that they were Ònot painting any weatherÓ on the radar.



Immediately after the turbulence encounter, the crew heard a crash in the galley and called the FAs to ask if they were alright.  The forward flight attendant, who was securing the galley by pouring out coffee in the lavatory, was thrown to the floor and twisted her legs in the lavatory door opening.  The cabin crew advised the FO that one of them might be hurt.  At 1229, the Captain asked Miami Approach Control to make sure there were no delays into FLL and to call for paramedics to meet the flight at the gate.  The controller acknowledged, and advised there would be no delay.  At 1233, the final controller position split off and a controller briefing occurred, including that Frontier 384 had an injured flight attendant and requested no delay, Òbut not an emergency.Ó  There was no mention of the request for paramedics.  The final controller vectored another aircraft onto an extended downwind to provide priority to the accident flight.



The injured FA was attended by medically qualified passengers in the front aisle.  One of the passengers, a surgeon, advised the FAÕs right leg was likely broken.  The FO tried to contact Frontier Operations at FLL six times with no response, and then tried to contact Frontier Dispatch, via the ACARS text messaging, also with no response.  Frontier reported that all station personnel were on the ramp preparing for the arrival.  ATC provided priority clearance to the airport and to taxi to the gate, but upon arrival at the gate there were no paramedics.  The FO again attempted to contact FLL operations, with no response.  The ramp controller (not a Frontier employee) confirmed that there were injuries on board and advised the FO that paramedics were on the way.  Shortly afterward, fire crew and paramedics arrived and transported the injured FA to the hospital.



INJURIES TO PERSONS



One flight attendant received a fracture to her right fibula. There were minor injuries reported to the two other flight attendants, however they were able to continue cabin crew duties and safety responsibilities.  There were no injuries to the two flight crewmembers, and 138 passengers (including one lap child).  



DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT



Frontier Airlines maintenance performed a post-flight severe turbulence inspection, and reported no findings.



PERSONNEL INFORMATION



The captain, age 40, held an FAA Airline Transport Pilot certificate, multi-engine land, with type ratings in the A320 and BE-1900.  He held an FAA first class medical certificate with no limitations or waivers.  He reported a total of 7,586 flight hours total time in the A319.



The first officer, age 41, held an Airline Transport Pilot certificate, multi-engine land, with type ratings in the A320, BE-300, CE-500, and CE-525S.  He held an FAA first class medical certificate with no limitations or waivers.  He reported a total of 4,837 flight hours total time in the A319.  



AIRCRAFT INFORMATION



N951FR, manufacturer serial number 4127, was an Airbus A319-112 equipped with two GE/SNECMA CFM-56 engines.  The airplane had approximately 7,408 hours total time on the airframe.  Recorded data and airline records indicated no relevant maintenance issues with the airplane.  



METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION



An NTSB Meteorologist compiled information from the Miami, Florida WSR-88d weather radar (KAMX).  At about 1220 EDT, the radar identified a very small area of light reflectivity values (<15 DBz) approximately 30 miles ahead of the accident aircraftÕs position.  At this point, the accident aircraft was descending through about 23,000 feet.  At the location of this reflectivity feature, the KAMX 1.51 degree sweep would have been ""seeing"" a height of about 10,000 feet (center beam).  At about 1226 EDT the radar revealed an intensification of reflectivity values for this feature in the 1.51 degree base reflectivity product.  This reflectivity intensification pattern at this height is consistent with developing convection.  The accident aircraft's flight path through 1226 EDT indicated that, at some point, the accident aircraft's position between the 1220 and 1226 EDT KAMX radar products was coincident with, or nearly coincident with, the developing convection. 

 

A north-south vertical cross-section of the KAMX base reflectivity data from 1226 EDT between the earth's surface and 20,000 feet indicated that at the time the accident aircraft passed the echoes, the highest reflectivity values (~35 DBz) in the convective cell had reached a height of approximately 12,000 feet.

 

A thorough review of meteorological data and National Weather Service products for the accident area during the times surrounding the accident time did not identify any mechanism for a significant turbulence encounter beyond the aforementioned developing convection.



The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting ÒwetÓ (convective) turbulence.  The FCTM states: Òto ensure efficient weather monitoring, the flight crew must effectively manage the tiltÉusually the appropriate tilt value provide ground returns on the top of the [display]Ó.  The radar display modes are weather only, weather plus turbulence, turbulence, and mapping.  Weather plus turbulence and turbulence modes detect Òwet turbulenceÓ within 40 nautical miles.



COMMUNICATIONS



Following the turbulence encounter, the flight crew was unable to establish communications with company dispatch or station personnel to alert emergency crews.  Additionally, the crewÕs declaration to ATC approach control regarding the need for paramedics to meet the flight at the gate was not coordinated with tower or other personnel.



FLIGHT RECORDERS



The Digital Flight Data Recorder was a Honeywell SSFDR, part number 980-4700-042.  The recorder was in good condition and the data were extracted normally from the recorder.  DFDR data is incorporated into the History of Flight section of this report.



The Cockpit Voice Recorder was a Honeywell 6022 Solid State CVR that recorded 2 hours of digital cockpit audio.  The recording channels which contained the last 30 minutes of audio from the captainÕs and first officerÕs audio panel was of fair quality.  A summary of the recording was completed.



SURVIVAL ASPECTS



The seat belt sign was illuminated and the cabin crew was still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing at the time of the event.",NA,"On May 10, 2012, at 1224 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) an Airbus 319, registration N951FR, operated by Frontier Airlines as flight 384, encountered turbulence resulting in serious injuries to a flight attendant during descent into the Fort Lauderdale Airport (FLL).  The flight was descending through 12,400 feet about 45 miles west of FLL at the time of the encounter.  The airplane was not damaged.



The flight crew reported that on initial descent into the Fort Lauderdale area they noticed typical Florida summertime cumulus cloud conditions.  About 20 minutes before the event, the Captain appropriately briefed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing early and to be seated after completing the initial clean-up. The flight crew subsequently illuminated the seat belt sign during the descent.  The flight attendants were still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing when the turbulence was encountered.



During descent, the airplane passed in and out of cloud formations.  The crew described, and CVR data is consistent with, passing out of a cloud and noticing a larger developing cumulus in front of them.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged.  The crew reported that the radar did not indicate any echoes ahead of them.  The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting ÒwetÓ (convective) turbulence.  As the airplane passed into the cumulus development, the airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of about +2 G and -0.5 G.  The activity was likely developing upwards, possibly below the field of view of the radar, and into the flight path.



As a result of the injuries to the forward flight attendant, the flight crew advised ATC that they had an injured crew member and requested priority handling and for paramedics to meet the airplane on arrival.  The ATC approach controller did not forward the request for paramedics.  The crew also attempted to contact the company station agents and dispatch, but received no response.  The lack of ATC coordination, and lack of company personnel to monitor communications from inbound flights, delayed the arrival of emergency medical personnel to meet the flight.","an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence developing upwards into the flight path, which was not detected on weather radar as configured by the crew.



Contributing to the delay in emergency medical personnel notification was the incomplete coordination of paramedic response by air traffic control and ineffective communications monitoring by Frontier Airlines.","FINAL","ACCIDENT","10-May-12","10000, 12000, 12400, 13000, 20000, 21000, 23000, 25000","12400"

There were no injuries to the airline transport rated captain or first officer, 2 flight attendants, or 71 passengers, while one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane which was not damaged was being operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jacksonville International Airport (JAX), Jacksonville, Florida. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the altitude, and location of the turbulence, for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan.



According to a chronological summary of communications, the flight was cleared to takeoff at 0755, and proceeded towards the destination airport, during which, air traffic control (ATC) communications were transferred to several different facilities.



The captain stated that when the flight was near Charleston, South Carolina (while in contact with the Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center (Jacksonville ARTCC)), they began descent from the cruise altitude. Knowing the weather was deteriorating ahead, he decided to turn on the seatbelt sign early for safety reasons. The ÒBÓ flight attendant who was in the back galley of the airplane later reported that after the seatbelt sign was turned on, he made, ÒÉthe seat belt announcement.Ó



The captain further reported that during the descent, the flight encountered what he described as a small pocket of light to moderate turbulence which lasted approximately 2 to 3 seconds, then smoothed out for most of the remainder of the flight, with some chop reported. About 1 minute after encountering the turbulence, one of the flight attendants contacted the flight deck and reported injury to one passenger who had gotten up after the seatbelt sign was illuminated and the seatbelt announcement was made. The captain made an announcement about the need to remain seated with seatbelts fastened, and called to the destination airport operations and requested medical equipment be standing by. According to the transcription of communications with Jacksonville ARTCC, there was no record that the pilot advised air traffic control of the turbulence encounter. The flight continued to the destination airport and landed without incident, where the injured passenger was transported to a local hospital for treatment of her injuries.



A relative of the passenger who sustained the serious injury and who was travelling with her reported that a connecting flight prior to the accident flight was delayed, and after landing they were rushed to board the airplane for the accident flight. Before the turbulence encounter he reported hearing an announcement to fasten their seatbelts; however, the passenger believed this was because the flight was close to the destination airport, and not related to weather conditions.
