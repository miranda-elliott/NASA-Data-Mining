"13","All cabin preparations and boarding of the passengers seemed to be normal. The main cabin door was closed for departure and pushback commenced. We taxied to the runway for departure, received the ready for takeoff communication from the 'A' flight attendant, and we departed.Once airborne, and through 10,000 feet the flight attendants were chimed and removed from sterile cockpit. The 'B' flight attendant began to make a P.A. announcement, which appeared to be louder than normal from the flight deck, however, not much was thought of it at the time and we continued on. Approximately, 20 minutes into the flight another P.A. announcement was made that caused concern. We called back to the flight attendants to see how things were going and to communicate our aircraft swap and gate information with them. The flight attendant in question answered the interphone. She was talking very loudly and with slurred speech. She did not sound like her normal self. We both were very alarmed by this behavior. We completed that quick conversation with her, waited a few minutes and called back hoping that the 'A' flight attendant would answer the interphone, she did. We obtained her assessment of the 'B' flight attendant, which was that she was acting very strange to include talking loud and slurred speech. The 'A' flight attendant said she was embarrassed by her behavior and concerned that something was wrong. On the flight deck we decided to take action. We coordinated with the controlling dispatcher, requested medical assistance, and discussed a possible diversion. We called back to the cabin again to verify the 'A' flight attendants assessment. Once that was completed at no time did we feel the safety of flight was jeopardized? We talked to the controlling dispatcher and a joint decision was made between the captain, the controlling dispatcher and me to continue to our destination. We coordinated an appropriate gate, medical assistance, and the base manager to be present. I believe this was absolutely the correct decision to continue to our destination. Our destination provided us better passenger handling and a timely resolution of the crewmember in question.","","10000","24000",FALSE
"15","We were cleared for the ILS23L, 3,000 FT until established and 180k to XEROX. At XEROX, still on approach, the controller issued the clearance 'XXX maintain 3000 FT and fly heading 140.' I initially didn't hear our call sign and thought it sounded like a clearance for another aircraft in the terminal area. After determining that the clearance was in fact for us a go around was initiated with the autopilot at first on and then disconnected, the turn to H140 was slow and altitude of 3,000 FT over shot by 550 FT.The clearance caused some level of confusion and delay since 'go around or discontinue approach' phraseology was not used by the controller. From that point better high altitude/approach and go around procedures and crew coordination were required in this situation. Better pilot/controller communication. Expecting the unexpected, with more thought given to go around procedures at a point other than minimums.","While on the ILS approach to Runway 23L at IND, the aircraft was descending through roughly 2600 FT on the Localizer and glide-slope (captured and tracking) autopilot was on. The Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Monitoring (PM) were discussing items relative to the approach when the Controller announced 'maintain 3000 FT fly heading 160.' No one seemed to hear it, except me, an Relief First Officer (RFO). While we were already below 3000 FT, it would be impossible to maintain something we had already passed through on the Glide-slope. Regardless, I asked PM, the First Officer to verify with ATC that those were indeed our instructions and that they were intended for us. PM at that point confirmed with ATC that those were our instructions. Never did I hear the terms cancel approach clearance or go around, perhaps those words were 'blocked'. Upon execution of the 'go around' we exceeded our clearance altitude.Improper, or non-standard phraseology during assignment of Go around/missed approach. Standard phraseology, probably would be a good idea to have controllers and pilots talk face to face from time to time, perhaps recurrent training or the like.","550, 2600, 3000","3550",FALSE
"22","In VMC at 4,500 MSL we encountered sustained moderate turbulence. During this time, we encountered an isolated incidence of severe turbulence, resulting in momentary loss of control, an altitude loss of approximately 200 feet, and the pilot and copilot striking their heads on the ceiling. There were no passengers on board. We were approximately 75 miles northeast of BIL.","","200","4500",FALSE
"30","While holding over ZZZ on an instrument training flight, I felt a significant left yaw and noticed the 'ball' deflect fully to the right. I asked the student if he were applying left rudder, and he told me that he was not. I took the flight controls from the student and noticed that I had to put in significant rudder pressure to center the 'ball.' I opened my emergency procedures checklist to the runaway trim procedure, and executed those emergency procedures. I contacted Approach, told them that I had a flight control malfunction, and asked to go back to the base. On the way I climbed to 7,000 MSL, and performed a controllability check. The airplane was controllable with heavy rudder pressure down to our final approach speed, so I elected to land. The landing was uneventful.","","7000","6000",FALSE

"34","On climb out on our second leg (after flying 10hrs31min) we were given a 5,000 feet level off. The aircraft over shot by seven hundred feet. We began a descent back to 5,000 feet. It was only a momentary over shoot. The pilot monitoring called out the deviation. There was no contact about the over shoot with ATC. We were all so tired that no one really cared. 2nd leg of a 12 hour flight is unsat and unsafe. We were dangerous the rest of the flight. In hind sight I should have stopped the jet at the original destination.We were fatigued and unsafe due to our schedule and time zone changes.Do not schedule multiple legs and use 2 extra pilots to justify over 12.

"37","As we were descending on a STAR arrival. We were [cleared to cross the next fix] at 10,000 feet and 250 knots. We were just preparing to begin the descent when suddenly I heard a noise like a cabin door opening inflight followed by what I recognized as the RAT beginning to spin up. This was followed immediately by an EICAS message of electrical emergency and multiple secondary messages/alerts. I called for the electrical emergency QRH procedure. ATC notified us ZZZ1 was 12 miles ahead. Considering the emergency, weather and the shorter runway [at our destination] we elected to divert into ZZZ1. While ATC was vectoring us for the approach the First Officer continued with the QRH procedure while setting up and briefing the approach. I notified the flight attendants and passengers as to our emergency and [that we] were diverting into ZZZ1. After successfully starting the APU, partial power and some systems were re-established. We broke out of the overcast layer approximately 1500 feet AFE and were able to complete the approach visually. I noticed and mentioned that we were receiving localizer information but no glide slope information, and ATC confirmed glide slope was functioning normally. Landing was accomplished without further incident and taxi to gate was normal, except when we got to the gate the landing lights would not extinguish even though the switches were in the off position. Passengers were deplaned and aircraft was shut down. Even with ground power attached, we could not gain control of landing and emergency lights in cabin and kept receiving spurious EICAS alerts. All of these items kept re-occurring until aircraft was completely shut down.[Although the cause was not evident, the] previous crew reported that even while flying through what they perceived as icing condition, no EICAS icing alert messages were generated. We [had] experienced the same thing. And while airborne, we checked the anti-ice system MFD page. Although the anti-ice system was never activated, we noticed the wing temperature indication go from 3 Celsius to 36 Celsius then back to 3 Celsius all the while indicating that the anti-ice valve to the wings was closed.","","1500, 10000","12000",FALSE
"39","During climb out a non-associated annunciator to the event being described had illuminated and was being corrected by the pilot monitoring via the Cockpit Operating Manual. During that time erroneous indications from the Captains and First Officer's Artificial Horizons made the pilot flying lose proper heading to the next fix. Throughout the next several moments both crew members communicated the indications being viewed on both sides of the flight deck. The Captain (pilot monitoring) had a 20 degree bank to the right in his ADI and the First Officer also had the same indication. The standby horizon was indicating wings level and a nose up attitude in the climb. Crew communications with ATC were made at that time to alert the controller of possible deviations from course but we believed we could still appropriately maintain altitude at all times. After minor trouble shooting it was believed that the standby horizon was the only instrument indicating the correct information. No circuit breakers or associated flags were popped nor flags in view of any guidance instruments. The crew contacted operations and received a diversion release for new fuel burns etc. for the rest of the intended flight. The flight was diverted to a destination other than the original destination due to the low IMC conditions at destination and were given several other locations to fly to in the event that the instrumentation got worse than what it was. The crew at times were still unsure of the proper heading and attitude due to the gyros not sending good information to the instruments. Because of this the crew asked the controllers several times to verify current track and to be aware that we could only follow the wet compass for the best heading and it appeared to correspond with the ground track of the GPS. Flight was continued to the new diversion airport with the assistance of ATC guiding the aircraft to a visual approach. All normal checklists were followed and a safe and uneventful landing was conducted.","During climb out the controllers had issued the crew a new clearance. As the pilot monitoring (PM) I had begun to make the appropriate changes to our course indicators, frequencies etc. to begin on the new route.  While I was performing these functions the Pilot Flying (PF) (First Officer) selected Airfoil Anti Ice ON and Engine Anti Ice ON without my knowledge. I believe shortly after the selection was made the Master Caution had quickly illuminated and extinguished (I cannot be exactly sure in what sequence that happened as I was unaware he had selected the Ice ON, it was not discovered immediately). At the time I was unaware of what annunciator had made the Master Caution illuminate. Then I had noticed the First Officer was using full MCL power during his climb with the ENG/Airfoil Ice selected. He should have been using a reduced setting of .08 less than what the RAT MCL was calling for. Almost immediately after the communication was made to the First Officer to use the reduction in power I became aware that the Master Caution had illuminated due to the Left Ice Protect Temp HIGH annunciator illumination. I began another scan quickly to check engine indications etc. to verify that the aircraft was still operating normally prior to reviewing the Cockpit Operating Manual for further instructions to clear the annunciator. As the scan took place it became evident to me that we were in OAT of approximately PLUS 22 C. This is well above our limitation of 'never operate' the Anti-Ice system above plus 10 C. My first action at that time was to select all Anti Ice systems OFF and verify that we were truly not in icing conditions. Then I communicated the violation to procedure of the first officer selecting the Anti-Ice without my knowledge and that we just need to discuss future items prior to selecting them to insure compliance with limitations and other variables. It was determined that we were not in icing conditions and if we continued to climb we would eventually require the Anti-Ice system in the future. I contacted ATC and asked to level off our altitude and described the problem to ATC. ATC allowed and we leveled at FL190.  The COM procedure had already been accomplished by the time we leveled off. OAT at FL190 was approximately plus 8 and it still took the annunciator several minutes to extinguish. The procedure does not elude to 'began diversion to nearest suitable' nor does it say 'continue operation' with associated side to the high indication in the OFF position. After the annunciator extinguished and several moments had passed with no other abnormal indications to the system I elected to continue our climb to our filed altitude with only the Right Airfoil selected and if the Ice Protect Temp Low lights had illuminated I would attempt to allow for the Left side to assist. All associated annunciators remained extinguished for the remainder of the climb. This flight had no other abnormals involving the Anti-Ice systems. But the flight was diverted due to other instrument problems and poor destination weather.I heavily believe in 'Guard the Good' when referring to precautionary shutdown of an engine and the PF will put his/her hand over a fuel control unit to insure the wrong fuel control will not be selected. Or something like cross feeding fuel is another good example of something that really needs to be communicated prior to the selection. And in a case like the Airfoil or Engine Anti Ice I am not sure why it gets turned ON and OFF so often without any type of communication. If a PM does something as simple as selects 'tail' ice, wouldn't the PF really want to know? I believe this to be a lack of communication from one pilot in this instance and possible a lack of aircraft limitation knowledge. But as a company whole, it does happen frequently that a 'Captain' will select Anti Icing systems ON without any communication to others involved and if he is not the one flying the 'PF' maybe unaware that he/she needs to make a power change. This may possibly be fixed with 'PM' touch instrument style of selection for the Anti-Ice systems. ei. If the PM notices that the OAT is plus 6 or less and visible moisture is present then he or she would announce 'Anti Ice is required'. The PF could then ASK for the selection to be made and the PM would then select the Anti-Ice associated with that scenario. (Inflight maybe more related to PM/PF and ground ops would be more PIC/SIC)","19000","34000",FALSE
"42","Weather at BOS reported as 10 sm visibility in light rain with ceiling at about 1000 feet. I briefed the runway 4R Category 1 ILS approach with a DH of 218. The runway has a displaced threshold and I briefed useable length as 8851 feet. I planned flaps full with auto brakes low. As we started the approach the weather began changing rapidly. Rain turned to snow and visibility started decreasing. ATIS updates were coming out every couple of minutes. We were switched to tower and advised the RVR was 2800 and there was a ship in the harbor with a height of 144 feet. On short final the controller advised the height of the ship was actually 148 feet. Very shortly afterward I picked up the approach lights and runway visually and executed a normal landing.I knew the runway had a displaced threshold to account for ships in the harbor and this is why I was not concerned with the tower controller's report. However, I was mistaken. After arrival at the gate, I again reviewed the approach chart and discovered that I had failed to brief the approach restrictions with ships in the harbor and particularly those with a height exceeding 144 feet. I was focused more on the changing weather and getting the aircraft on the ground and disregarded the controller's information.","","144, 148, 1000, 8851","600",FALSE
"43","While on last leg of a 4-day trip on RNAV arrival and subsequent vectors to final approach course to ILS 8R. I was the First Officer (FO) and Pilot flying. We had a 100 knots tail wind on the Arrival and a significant tailwind from the west at this point. We were given vector of 060 degrees, maintain 5,000 feet until established localizer, cleared the ILS 8R. Outside of IF, I joined the LOC on FMS pink needles and then switched to GREEN needles. Then upon LOC intercept and given 190 KIAS until 9 DME. I deployed flight spoilers. We were slightly above glideslope and ATC told us to slow to 170 KIAS. I ordered gear down and flaps 22. Weather conditions were IMC in Heavy rain with significant tail wind. The Captain (Nonflying Pilot) noted another aircraft on TCAS nearby to our right side. Near the 9 DME passing through 3,000 we set MAP altitude 3,000 feet on Altitude alerter. I believe we were inside 9 DME when ATC suddenly told us to turn to heading 180 degrees and climb maintain 5,000 feet. The ambient noise level was louder due to aircraft configuration and ATC chatter. Captain asked ATC for clarification due to another aircraft near that side. We hesitated turning momentarily due to our concern with the close proximity of the aircraft to our right. I attempted to disengage Autopilot (AP) and manually fly the turn and climb, the AP would not initially disengage. I saw a red colored 'AP' on the PFD and hear loud 'Autopilot, Autopilot,' oral while ATC also attempted to talk but was blocked by oral warnings in cockpit. The AP oral warning 'Autopilot, autopilot,' continued to enunciate along with 'GlideSlope' and 'Bank Angle.' The aircraft attitude was in normal parameters. We attempted turning with heading bug but again AP would not work. Eventually AP disengaged and manually in the turn to the right, I heard TCAS, TA 'Traffic' enunciate once. We were then told to climb to 5,000 feet, heading 180 degrees; and then turn to something like heading 220 degrees. While I flew manually, the Captain attempted to reengage the AP and explained to ATC of what the situation was with AP problem. We climbed to 5,000 feet and eventually got AP reengaged momentarily but then it malfunctioned again. I manually flew the aircraft and ATC vectored us around back onto ILS 8R flown manually by me with no further complications. After landing while taxiing we did an Autopilot test and the test was successful.Upon landing ATC tower gave us a telephone number and Captain called TRACON.  The Supervisor said we lost spacing separation with another aircraft landing at a nearby GA satellite airport when we failed to stop descent at 4,000 feet. When we asked Supervisor why were instructed to turn 180 degrees, he stated that the final approach controller (still working his station) was attempting to insert another flight in front of us, but then the spacing did not work out. We suggested that we should have been given a Go Around instead of a vector so close to the ILS final approach fix at that critical phase of flight. Furthermore, our aircraft's abnormal automation behavior and interfering cockpit automation orals and conflicting ATC instructions to turn towards a nearby aircraft further complicated the situation in a critical, time sensitive condition of flight. The supervisor seemed to agree and understood the collective threats culminating into the situation. He said he would talk to the actual controller once he came off his station. And a report must be sent to FAA.The aircraft state was safe and in normal parameters during the vector to approach and initial approach intercept. The threats accumulated as we intercepted the localizer on the ILS 8R. Threats included:1. Weather: IMC, low ceiling and visibility, heavy rain. Strong tail wind with turbulence during STAR descent and transition to ILS 8R2. Other aircraft in unexpected close relative position to our aircraft.3. FO was using new TELEX 750 headset with foam ear plugs instead of the uncomfortable company issue non-sound suppression headset. Captain was using a commercial full-ear covering sound suppression headset.4. Radio chatter and louder ambient cockpit noise level due to aircraft slowing configuration while descending. Made it difficult to hear ATC clearly. FO should have increased volume on new headset when cockpit noise increased on the approach.5. Automation refused to quickly decouple and subsequent loud CAS Orals, TCAS TRAFFIC, bogus GLIDESLOPE and BANK ANGLE orals and Autopilot disconnect Oral made it very difficult to hear entire ATC message of instructions.6. The apparent ATC instructed level at 4,000 feet was not set into the Altitude Alerter while on the ILS glideslope. Flight crew could have been better at monitoring, verification and cross talk regarding ATC instructions. Flight Crew became very busy dealing with multiple threats in just a few seconds.7. ATC's attempt to insert another flight in front of us and give us vectors close to FAF in IMC towards nearby other aircraft should not have happened. We should have been instructed to execute a Go Around. In the future in same situation--I will tell ATC we are Going Around and not turn towards the other aircraft.8. We were not aware of altitude deviation (below '4,000 feet') until ATC informed us during the turn to 180 degrees. 9. Crew's last approach at end of a 4-day trip/ end of duty day. While we were ready for the trip to end and go home--We were not fatigued.I suggest several things to improve upon are illuminated by this event:1. Crew members should use sensory equipment of similar capability level. (i.e., one pilot with an expensive noise cancelling headset and the other with a normal cost pilot headset that does not have noise cancelling. This concept is similar to the military's requirement that all flight crew have same generation of NVGs for vision. The air crew must have a similar sensory experience and expectation of crew mates hearing the ATC. Company should provide better more comfortable headsets so crew members would be inclined to use company issued headsets. I personally will no longer use the TELEX 750 in an EMB 135/145. It is just too noisy.2. ATC should be more cognizant of the impact on weather, airspace, and critical stage of flight on ILS in IMC, imperfect radio communications and cockpit automation oral distractions, on aircrew's ability to manage tasks and hear time sensitive maneuvering instructions. The attempt to have us go down and slow down with such a tail wind while ATC attempted to insert another flight in front of us and then vector us towards another nearby aircraft and the associated pilot cross talk, aircraft orals warnings, improperly performing automation and time needed to clarify ATC's instruction so close to FAF 3. Air crew should have set 4,000 feet in Altitude Alerter when it was given by ATC. But When I heard maintain 4,000 feet, we were already approaching 3,000 feet.In summary, this event is just the type of CRM/TEM Swiss Cheese accident chain of events taught in the school house. I will use it at my next recurrent training class discussion.","There were many threats starting with marginal weather and a high traffic environment. After being cleared and mostly configured for an approach we were given break off instructions that the crew could not verify due to one not having heard the full instructions. Could not get immediate confirmation from ATC and when we did the loud aircraft warning messages blocked ATC instructions. Timing of and amount of instructions and execution requirements made for a high workload that kept us from executing the instructions.I have to focus more on how to manage my workload in this type of environment. The sequence I choose will certainly impact the outcome of events.","180, 220, 3000, 4000, 5000","2800",FALSE
"51","On arrival into BOS (QUABN 3 RNAV), we were given a clearance of UROWT at 11,000 feet then descend via the QUABN 3, 4R transition into BOS. Between UROWT and QUABN, ATC gave us a heads up that a VFR aircraft was at our 1 O'clock position, opposite direction, at 6,000 feet climbing to 12,500 feet.  We began to look for the traffic that we had on TCAS, [but] before we could locate it, we got a climbing TCAS RA with a vertical speed of about 2,000 fpm, which I responded to immediately, and the captain notified ATC. The RA then adjusted vertical speed to nearly level then gave us another climbing RA this time of about 1,500 fpm.  I again followed the TCAS RA, this time after following the guidance of the RA it cleared us of the conflict. The captain let ATC know both times about the TCAS RA and they were indifferent about what we had done.  We proceeded to follow the rest of the QUABN RNAV arrival with altitude and speeds on target.ATC should [have] never cleared VFR opposite direction traffic through an altitude that another aircraft was on.  ATC should [have] been more diligent in diverting the two airplanes away from each other.","The controller seemed unconcerned about the conflict. I thought it weird that they would have traffic climbing to an altitude above our bottom altitude but didn't have time to query the controller about the instruction given to the VFR aircraft.","1500, 2000, 6000, 11000, 12500","10000",FALSE
"57","Prior to the start of the arrival we had been deviating around thunderstorms and I had put the ATIS on auto update since there were thunderstorms in DCA.  Around FL240 we had been told to expect the south transition. However, ATC changed us to the north transition and then back again to the south transition based on changing winds at the airport. At FL210, they cleared us for the FRDMM arrival. During this time they then cleared us via the TRUPS. I inquired and that was given in error and we were recleared to descend via the FRDMM arrival. I also inquired on landing runway since the ATIS was giving a different runway than he assigned. He said that the ATIS was giving out the wrong runway ONLY.    I started to notice that the ATIS updates were changing at a rapid pace, consistent with a thunderstorm passing over the field. The first ATIS included a squall line passing. We initially received an ATIS and by the time the events ended we were back [near beginning of the alphabet.] I do not remember being given an altimeter setting from ATC and when we performed the inrange [checklist] I gave the most up-to-date altimeter setting which was 29.54 to the Captain (CA).   As we were approaching PLDGE, the controller told us to immediately stop our descent and to hold at PLDGE. We were less than 5 miles from PLDGE and quickly rushed to put the hold in the FMS. He said expect 1 turn in the hold and to level at 17,000. Also, we were instructed to slow as well. He said all of this was due to flow into DCA. We had started to hold when the controller asked us what altitude we were at. I said 17,000 and he confirmed that this was not what he was showing. I said we were level at 17,000 and current altimeter 29.54. He quickly stated that this was wrong and current altimeter was 30.04. He said he informed us earlier that the ATIS was wrong. The CA and I both agreed that earlier he had told all aircraft on frequency that the runways were wrong and that was it. There was no mention about altimeter. The controller told us we were not listening. Numerous other aircraft were inquiring about runway and altimeter settings.     After one turn we were recleared direct to PLDGE and given a descent to 16,000. As we started to descend he told us again to descend to 16,000 and once there recleared the FRDMM arrival. We had unfortunately took that as a 'descend via' and not a 'cleared via' The controller inquired about our altitude being off and informed us of our error of descend vs cleared. From there the rest of the arrival was uneventful and we asked for correct altimeter settings with each frequency change. Initial threats were the arrival itself and thunderstorms in the area. During the arrival we were given unexpected close holding, speed reduction, and descents that were not on the arrival. ATC also gave us the wrong arrival and switched landing runways 3 times. ATC only informed us that the ATIS included the wrong runway and DID NOT mention that the altimeter settings being produced were wrong. The errors were the two altitude deviations. The second coming from a high stress and workload environment created from the first one. I believe the quick hold, descent, and speed reduction, followed by the constant weather updates and deviating with storms caused us to confuse the descend via and the cleared via clearance at the end of the event. I believe we should have told ATC we were unable for the hold. We were too close to the fix and combined with our altitude and speed reduction our workload was already too high. Especially after dealing with the wrong altimeter setting and confusion. I also think there needs to be clarification if the ATIS is wrong. When we landed in DCA and asked ground if the departure ATIS was correct he informed us that it was a national outage and that they were producing wrong information. I think this was an urgent issue and should have been communicated better with working crews, possibly via a messagefrom dispatch or ATC. When I first inquired about the runway change on arrival, the controller had no idea that it had been changing to begin with. He informed us only that the runway on the ATIS was wrong and nothing else.","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","21000, 24000","17000",FALSE
"69","This evening, I decided to take off from my airport (SFZ), visit a nearby VOR, and return. It was intended as a quick, easy flight.Warning signs about the day manifested itself with a call. The WX briefer mentioned that there was an AIRMET for moderate turbulence below 8,000 as well as an urgent PIREP for low level wind shear at an airport about 30 NM away. Winds at North Central (SFZ) were 33014G21KT. These were right down one of our two runways, and I was seeking out more challenging conditions to push my personal minimums.The line worker told me 'good luck with those winds' as she was fueling my airplane. I told her that they were right down the runway and she agreed with a 'yeah, I guess so. I guess you should be okay.'After preflight and taxi, I started my run-up. I noticed that the plane was really getting buffeted on the ground by the winds and I thought to myself, 'this is rather windy.' I considered turning around but told myself that I came this far and I may as well fly, with the stipulation that if I felt uncomfortable while airborne I would return immediately. I finished my run-up and took off.I climbed to about 2,000 feet or so and was on my way to the Putnam VOR. Almost immediately after passing 1,000 feet I started to experience moderate turbulence. Shortly after the plane banked 30 degrees to the left in under a second without me changing any flight controls. I decided to abort my flight immediately.A 180 degree set me up for a 45 entry to 33. Due to the winds the plane was essentially ground-tracking sideways. The sensation was that of not flying forward but instead to the side with a massive crab. This spooked me, and this is where my questionable aeronautical decision making of taking off turning into a poor decision. My base for 33 was so unusual and I was feeling so uncomfortable with the situation that I decided to climb and join the pattern for the longer, wider runway 23. At this point, I both consciously and subconsciously just wanted to get on the ground. I was finding myself in somewhat unusual attitudes while fighting to maintain altitude, and the AWOS was now reporting winds variable between 270 and 350 13G27... a 15 knot gust factor with unpredictable winds. An experienced professional pilot may have had no problems with this, but I am not that pilot. I was determined to get on the ground but also scared. What I should have done was abort the approach to 33, overfly the field on the upwind, and reenter the pattern and try again. Instead, I decided to switch to the wider, 'safer' runway. Instead of having a gusty, wind-shear-prone approach with winds right down the runway, they were now giving me a direct crosswind with all the same wind-related problems. Keep in mind that my Skyhawk has a max demonstrated crosswind component of 15 knots; I was now becoming the proverbial 'test pilot'.Predictably, my approach was very poor. Approach speed in my 172 is 75MPH with flaps up and 70MPH with flaps down; I was approaching with 100MPH with 10 degrees in. I knew this as well and instead of going around, I said to myself 'I have 7,000 feet(!) of runway; I will float down the runway for a considerable period of time so let it float and it'll come down when it's ready.' There are two problems with this line of reasoning: I didn't have 7,000 feet, I had 5,000, and that crosswind had a slight tailwind component to it as well. As predicted, I floated for what seemed like a very long time. Finally, the wheels came down, but I started porpoising. I let it bounce a few times, hoping to let it settle, but the end of the runway was fast approaching. After four bounces I executed a sloppy go-around in which I forgot to turn off the carb heat. There's a church that we are supposed to use as a noise abatement landmark that indicates we can make turns at 1,450 feet MSL... I was at 750 feet MSL by the time I was over the church. The airport altitude is around 50 MSL.Thankfully, my trainingregarding avoiding power-on stalls and spins by not pitching up aggressively and utilizing heavy right rudder on takeoff prevented me from making a poor situation even worse. After gaining my composure I set up for a base entry to runway 33, like I should have in the first place. I was able to set up a respectable approach to 33, landed the airplane, and put in an urgent PIREP very shortly after tying down.I am very fortunate to be able to submit this report right now. I ventured forth into conditions that I thought I could handle and those conditions turned out to be beyond what I can handle at this stage in my private aviation career. I made a series of poor decisions regarding bad Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM), specifically go/no-go, subpar runway selection and sloppy go-around technique that could have very easily bent metal or worse, ended up with me killing myself. This all happened within the span of 30 minutes. I intend on talking with an instructor regarding this experience and to fix my go-around technique, and hopefully I will avoid situations like this in the future.","","750, 1000, 1450, 2000, 7000","450",TRUE
"78","High workload descent into ABQ. We were deviating for weather, trying to descend from a late let down, had turbulence, and communicating with Dispatch for possible new alternate. Approach gave us 5000 feet, we read back 5000 feet, and set 5000 feet into the MCP. At 8700 feet, I queried ATC about our 5000 feet clearance (ABQ field elevation 5315 feet) and the Controller quickly changed our descent clearance to 8500 feet. We were vectored for the approach and landed uneventfully.","[Report Narrative Contained No Additional Information].","5000, 5315, 8500, 8700","19000",FALSE
"130","Weather Event. Cracked L2 window.","I was FC on the flight. I did my normal duties of the outside walk-around prior to leaving. About 10 minutes prior to departure time we received a normal clearance via voice. We had a normal push back, start-up and taxi. The initial climb out was normal and soon after 10,000 feet I began to figure out the break times for the flight. I could see weather ahead on the Captain's radar and knew we would have to deviate right, which we did. It was extremely difficult to get a word in on the radio, but FO was able to get a turn from approximately 060 degrees to heading 090. It soon became obvious we would need more of a deviation to stay out of the weather. FO repeatedly tried to get a further deviation. There was constant chatter on the frequency and we were not able to get a further vector so Captain elected to turn further anyway. We were outside the edge of the weather when it suddenly became extremely loud in the cockpit because of, what I thought was, heavy rain. It was evident later that we were in hail, although I never saw hail. The noise from the hail/rain lasted approximately 2 minutes. It was basically a white-out during which we experienced severe turbulence for maybe 10 seconds. During the turbulence at FL210 we got an altitude warning. I am not sure how far off our altitude we became. After the turbulence subsided we realized the Captain's left window was cracked and our weather radar was inoperative. We could also hear a groan/humming noise coming from the radome area. Captain told FO to tell ATC we had to return. It was decided that we would land overweight rather than dump fuel. I figured the landing distance for the overweight landing and determined the departure runway was sufficient. FB (Relief Officer) called Dispatch and Operations to inform them we were on our way back. Captain landed gently and used most of the runway to slow. We exited the runway and stopped the airplane. We did not set the brakes. It was difficult for ground control to understand we needed the brakes to be checked for overheating. Eventually, they understood and asked us to shut down the engines so the inspection could be made. After the inspection we were towed to a hardstand where we were met by station personnel. The passengers and crew were able to exit the airplane via airstairs.","10000, 21000","20000",FALSE
"133","We encountered severe turbulence last about 5 seconds in clouds while deviating around thunderstorms. The radar was on and operational but was not painting strong echoes on our current flight path. The turbulence was immediate (went from very light to severe instantaneously). The aircraft initially rolled about 25 degrees to the left and lost about 200 feet. The auto pilot and auto throttles self-disconnected. The command bars disappeared from view. The First Officer (PF) manually rolled the wings level and climbed back to altitude. After the turbulence subsided the flight directors, auto throttle and auto pilot were re-engaged. The seat belt sign was on and according to the flight attendants all passengers were seated at the occurrence time. The flight attendants took their seats immediately. I made a re-enforcing PA to the passengers to adhere to the seatbelt sign. Once the aircraft was back under control with the auto pilot on I called the lead FA to make sure everyone was ok. She verified all FAs were ok and not injured. I asked about passenger injuries. She said she'd check and get back to me. One passenger had spilled hot water on her hand and fingers. The flight attendants administered ice and Neosporin. I made a severe turbulence PIREP to ATC and they asked about damage or injuries. I stated no apparent damage and one passenger injury including the extent. I contacted dispatch regarding the turbulence and passenger injury and dispatch made arrangements for paramedics to meet the flight. A severe turbulence write up was entered in the logbook and sent via ACARS to Maintenance Control. I communicated with the Duty Manager via ACARS as well.","","200","35000",FALSE
"135","This is the second time in so many months that I have been on hold by Dispatch for a weather forecast, but it seems that the weather center is not keeping up with real time conditions. We departed for MDW an hour late, due to MDW forecast for T-Storms and frontal passage. About 15 minutes from landing, the front was about 15 miles away to the north. We were being vectored onto RWY 22L on a NW HDG. ATC put a Company jet between us and another Company approximately 10 miles ahead. To get spacing, they gave us direct STERE (a northerly HDG) and clearance for the approach. Storms were still N of our position and N of STERE by about 7 and 4 miles respectfully.Within about 30 seconds, we started experiencing moderate turbulence and windshear. I told the FO to turn and told ATC we needed a turn. It was granted. In the turn away from weather, we got severe turbulence, to include violent abrupt yaw moments, airspeed flux of 30-40 knots, and bank angles in excess of 45 degrees. ATC gave us an airspeed of 210 or less. I said 'unable.' We had altitude deviation of 500 feet. We escaped to the SW and paralleled the approach course.After it smoothed out, we attempted to reacquire the approach course just south of downtown Chicago. We experienced a very strong updraft. Concerned it would be followed by a downdraft and well above glidepath, we went around to the south. ATC gave us vectors to a visual downwind for another attempt. After switching to Tower, and on base, Tower reported a windshear alert of 35 knots on final. We decided to go around since we were again experiencing large wind shifts. We diverted to our alternate.What disappointed me also was the lack of credibility our pilots in following aircraft put in our report. Two airplanes behind us continued on a similar path; we were just a minute or two before them. They also experienced severe turbulence. After hearing that behind us, I told Chicago Approach, that no other planes should be allowed to fly through that.It was the worst turbulence I had experienced in my flying experience of [over two decades]. Aircraft control was lost for certain periods of time and our other pilots decided it was okay to fly into that. We obviously were not able to maintain our assigned clearance due to the turbulence. We were unable to maintain the assigned course, altitude, or airspeed. The weather center needs to real-time update weather holds for current radar conditions to not place jets in greater danger. Our pilots need to listen up and wise up, and trust Company Pilot reports.","","500","3000",FALSE
"141","Descending around thunderstorms, Tower told us to slow to approach speed for a departing aircraft. Notified by Tower approaching 1000 feet of abrupt wind shift which would give us a 17 knot tailwind. The airplane in position on the runway requested the winds again and decided not to launch. We realized the winds were out of limits for our approach, and notified tower around 1000 feet AGL of our intention to go around. Tower said that we didn't need to do that, but just to climb to 2500 feet and continue, but go around was already initiated using TOGA levers. The pilot monitoring was changing the altitude from the 3500 feet we had previously set for a visual missed to 2500 feet as assigned as I was trying to hit altitude hold. Signals got crossed and I elected to hand fly as the airplane was now climbing quite rapidly. There was some confusion on the radio as to what heading we were to fly and how the controller wanted us to return to land in the opposite direction, and the distraction of trying to get the airplane out of [go around] mode (heading select) led to an overshoot of 500 feet on the level off. We were VMC with no separation issues, and Tower did not comment except to clear us back down to 2500 feet. The Tower Controller was then pushing us to initiate a teardrop or switch back to approach for an extended downwind. PM asked for a 6 mile final, but even after we reconfigured quickly with maximum drag, we were just barely stable at 500 feet for the landing. We realized after landing that the approach speeds were not reset for the higher wind component (17 knots) on final.Expectation bias on the initial missed approach. I was thinking about a normal go around, but the Controller wanted us to perform a discontinued approach. We were already throttled up and climbing when the controller asked us to level off at a lower altitude. Too many hands were working the glare shield controls [MCP] at once, and altitude hold was not selected in a timely manner. Hand flying was then the best option, but I lost situational awareness when the conversation became about heading and missed the level off. We then let ourselves be talked into a shorter approach than we wanted after the missed approach, causing us to feel rushed to land.Decide on a course of action and stick with it. If it's going to be a normal go around, then do that. If it's going to be a discontinued approach, then make it clear to the other crewmember who will be pushing the buttons. If more time is needed after an unusual event (i.e.: go around) to get set up for another try, then take the time and don't let ATC rush the process. Above all, fly the airplane!","","500, 1000, 2500, 3500","3000",FALSE
"159","We were conducting a Part 91 passenger flight. Due to significant convective activity and associated turbulence in the southwestern U.S. we, along with other aircraft in the vicinity were experiencing light to moderate continuous turbulence, as well as thunderstorm activity along our route. In an effort to adequately avoid the thunderstorms as well as find smoother air we requested and received a block altitude of FL450-470. Shortly thereafter the issuing controller asked us if we were able to maintain FL470, as there were many aircraft deviating and looking to climb to avoid weather. We climbed to FL470 to accommodate the controller's request and cancelled the block altitude.Two sectors later... (where our problems begin). While still in cruise at FL470 we were handed off to another Denver center controller. We had just passed about 25 miles south of the last of the significant thunderstorms. We were is relatively smooth air, with light wave activity from the associated storms when the controller instructs us to descend to FL450. Being downwind of the storm activity, we were hesitant to descend and requested a vector to remain at altitude and to accommodate what we assumed was conflicting traffic. The controller then informed us that there was no traffic, but we were at the wrong altitude for direction of flight and had to descend. We found this a little ridiculous and began to argue our case with the controller who's only response was that we couldn't know the flight conditions at FL450 because we were not there and we had to descend to see if meteorological conditions then warranted our request for FL470.We acquiesced to the controller's request, began a descent and immediately entered into light increasing to moderate turbulence. The report did not satisfy the controller who reaffirmed that since we still not leveled at FL450 we could not yet return to FL470. Eventually leveling at FL450, in continuous moderate turbulence we were allowed to return to FL470 for the remainder of our flight.It bothers me that a controller working in airspace known for its hazardous weather would be so willing to disregard the reports from a flight crew in his airspace as to the current conditions, as well as ignore their requests for some reprieve to escape them. My only conclusion is that new controllers aren't receiving adequate training in meteorology as it pertains to aviation.","","45000, 47000","46500",FALSE
"162","I landed at Desert Rock because of bad weather. My destination was Boulder City/BVU, NV. I waited for the weather to improve and considered my alternatives. Weather wise Beatty/BTY, NV appeared to be the best idea. However, the airport phone number 775-751-6855, [and several other local facility phone numbers] were all reported as non working numbers when I called them. [The local car rental] facility had no listed number.I decided to fly to Boulder City since the weather in the direction of Boulder City was visibly improving. I got a standard briefing and filed a flight plan with 1-800-wxbrief. Weather at Boulder City was forecast to be winds 230/04, visibility 10SM, 2000 scattered, 4200 scattered and 7000 overcast. There was an AIRMET of 'turbulence below 16,000 feet'. Route of flight was direct Jean/OL7, NV direct Boulder City/BVU, NV because of Class B airspace. Time enroute was 45 minutes. I asked for flight service frequencies to open my flight plan. I was given 122.4 and 122.35 for Reno Radio. I asked for a Las Vegas Approach Control frequency and was given Nellis Approach Control 118.3. I took off from Desert Rock. I immediately encountered moderate to severe turbulence. I called the three frequencies listed above with no response. I continued calling the frequencies as I proceeded south. It became obvious as I flew south that I could not fly my planned route because of clouds and turbulence. I started to fly over a ridge line on my route and was bounced around so much that my head hit the top of the cabin repeatedly and at one time the airspeed went from 90MPH to 160MPH instantly. I altered course to basically fly along the foothills as I proceeded south. I tried to find a Las Vegas Approach Control frequency on the Las Vegas Sectional chart. I was bouncing around so much I was unable to read any small print. I decided to use my GPSs to go under Class Bravo airspace and avoid Class Delta airspace at Henderson Executive/HND, NV. In my opinion that is what I did. I landed at Boulder City and taxied to the fuel pump. One of the line crew handed me a note to call the Las Vegas TRACON. I called and was told that I had 'Busted Class B airspace'. I told him I thought I had flown under it. He did not ask me about any of the difficulties outlined above. I did advise him that I had tried to contact Nellis Approach Control on 118.3 with no response. (This was the frequency given me by flight service when I asked for a Las Vegas Approach control frequency-see above.) He said 'there would be an investigation'. I got a radio check on my two radios before I left the fuel pump. Both checked OK. I checked them again before I departed Boulder City [the next day]. Both checked fine again. I was able to open my Boulder City/BVU, NV to Deer Valley/DVT, AZ flight plan with Reno Radio on 122.4 as I departed Boulder City.","","16000","4500",FALSE
"164","Inbound to DAL the aircraft had reached FL450. Approximately 35 minutes into the flight, we experienced a failure of the left front windshield outer pane. The windshield was completely covered in cracks and the heating system was lost. We advised Center of the issue and requested descent which was complied with. Our original clearance was to the STNLI Intersection for the JFRYE2 RNAV Arrival. At some point, ATC recleared us via the NANDR2, direct GREGS comply with the speeds and altitudes at GREGS. At GREGS intersection the RNAV descent was initiated and the next crossing restriction was between 6,000 and 8,000 feet at GUUCH followed by 6,000 feet at NANDR and 5,000 feet at CROEW. At some point after GUUCH and prior to NANDR, the aircraft began a descent earlier than NANDR. The crew did not notice, nor was there an audible altitude alert, the early descent and because of the next crossing restriction was 5,000, it appeared the aircraft was descending normally. Just prior to CROEW, the aircraft continued to descend and I recognized it at approximately 4,700 feet; 300 feet below the crossing restriction. The PF arrested the descent and began recovering the altitude which may have exceeded 400 feet.The company has been understaffed for several months and this flight crew had an extreme schedule due to the lack of personnel. The company was notified and requested, and received, that no additional flights be added to the schedule until the staffing issue can be resolved.In addition, the flight crew should be aware and competent in the operation of the aircraft systems, situational awareness and the particular process of the VNAV operational sequences.","","300, 400, 4700, 5000, 6000, 8000, 45000","4600",FALSE

We departed within moments of a B737, and were assigned the same departure and altitude. The autopilot was engaged at 1,000 feet AGL, a normal procedure, it failed to capture the assigned altitude, and may have exceeded altitude by as much as 400 feet. The auto pilot was deselected, and flown manually back to 3,000 feet. At some point it was also found that the number 1 FMS had gone to 'Maneuver' mode, from the previously selected 'Nav' and would not reset. This was only noticed after the aircraft was being manually flown. The copilot side auto pilot and the number2 FMS was then selected, and appeared normal.I am not sure how or if the FMS failure might have contributed to the incursion, but it was very coincidental, that the 2 events happened together. The incursion may of only been caused by the 'general' turbulence, or by the wake from the departing B737. There were several attempts to reset the FMS, such as pressing Nav, Fltplan, Fuel buttons, etc. The unit was eventually powered down, and then seemed normal.There was no ATC exchange about this, only prior to take off 'caution wake turbulence'.I discussed the situation with my copilot, no other corrective action could have been taken in the circumstance. I will discuss the FMS failure with the manufacturer ASAP.","","400, 1000, 3000","3400",FALSE

I chose not to continue the flight into night IMC. Due to the poor communications on Radio #2 I climbed 500 feet above an altitude assigned.

"201","After getting a weather briefing the night before and the morning of the flight. The ceilings were forecasted from 1400-3800 feet AGL. We departed ZZZ1 to fly about 25 miles toward where the weather was, just to see if there was any way around or under the weather. Icing was forecasted at 11,000 feet MSL.We saw what looked like a way around the weather and got around it and then stared to fly further north to see if we could continue. We soon realized that the weather was getting worse quickly. We started to turn around and the weather had dropped too low to continue back to our departure point.We then saw clear skies above and proceeded to climb to 12,500 feet. We were able to get above about 80% of most of the weather. We continued north over a broken layer of clouds. About 30 mins into the flight the clouds below started to close in and rise up.At this point we contacted ATC and asked for an IFR clearance to [destination] airport. Once we entered the clouds after getting our clearance, we started to ice up and it was freaking out my student. So I [advised] ATC and started a 180 turn to get back to the better weather behind us. We got back to where the sky was clear above and informed ATC that we were going to circle to try to shed about 1/4 inch of mixed/rime ice that was on the aircraft.ATC then asked us to climb to 14,000 feet. We tried and could only get the aircraft to about 13,650 feet and then called ATC and informed them that was all we had. ATC then had us turn more south to stay out of high terrain. About this time our first bottle of oxygen ran out and we had to buddy breath on our second bottle of oxygen. At this point we had to try for [the destination airport] and re-enter the icing conditions. With outstanding help from ATC we worked to aircraft down slowly as it built up more ice. I was able to keep the aircraft about 300-500 feet above most of the lower altitudes that ATC informed us of.We finally broke out about 20 miles from [the destination airport] and landed safely.","","500, 3800, 11000, 12500, 13650, 14000","13500",FALSE

Crew never received a 'Pull-up' message during maneuver, just the 'Terrain' alert.Continued climb to a safe altitude, continued flight. Evaluated what happened, crew believes they put so much attention on single-engine out procedures they neglected the regular ODP procedure.","Crew cleared as filed which entailed a left turn to MIP VOR. Crew thoroughly briefed engine-out climbout procedures due to local terrain but unintentionally overlooked the all-engine ODP procedures.

Shortly thereafter, received 'Obstacle' and 'Terrain' EGPWS alerts, but did not receive a 'Pull Up' alert. Climb rate was increased and alerts ended, estimate that terrain was cleared by approximately 600 feet.I was Pilot Flying and briefed the departure, I believe that some human factors affected my unintentionally overlooking the ODP. As stated above, we were very focused on the engine-out procedures due to the low weather and mountainous terrain. Although I fully understand the role of ODPs, I think that on some level I unconsciously associated ODPs with uncontrolled airports since most of my experience actually using ODPs has been at such airports. For prevention of future recurrences, I believe that training can better emphasize the role ODPs play at both controlled and uncontrolled airports. In addition, I believe that training should emphasize that a 'Cleared as Filed' clearance should prompt the pilot(s) to confirm the presence/absence of an ODP. Finally, although this might be excessive, including the verbiage something like 'ODP available' when the clearance is issued would serve as a backstop to crew awareness.","600, 1000, 1600","1800",FALSE
"211","Four minutes after takeoff rate of climb decreased from 789 ft/min to 250 ft/min. Airspeed decreased from ground speed of 69 knots to ground speed of 54 knots. Then a loud bang. Plane slid back and rolled to right. Plane dropped 2150 feet in 2 minutes. Was able to level plane at 2200 MSL. Was not able to keep heading. Wings were not stable. Coordinated flight was not possible. Made a complete circle before being able to fly somewhat straight. HSI had tumbled as had the attitude indicator. Asked departure control (NorCal) what was my magnetic heading. Significantly differed from reading on HSI. HSI was not stable. Magnetic compass was not helpful due to roll, and not being able to fly straight and level. Tossed around violently.At some point, someone told the controller to ask if I had autopilot. I answered yes. The person helping the controller told him to have me turn on autopilot and set heading. That was a mistake. The autopilot, within 10 seconds, pitched up to maximum pitch. Pitch warning signal sounded. Red pitch light on, the annunciator turned on. The autopilot could not keep wings level. I managed to disconnect the autopilot, and turned to land towards SNS. I made the decision that I had to land. The controller determined that the closest VMC airport was ZZZ. I flew there with difficulty on maintaining level altitude. Was in IMC most of the flight. Winds were gusting and swirling until I reached 8300 MSL. At ZZZ on the descent, had to deploy 10 degrees of flaps 11 miles out to descend to pattern altitude. Landed safely with wife and dog aboard. Secured plane. Returned with mechanic who did inspection, and then we flew the plane VFR. HSI is being sent for inspection of gyro. Autopilot will be checked completely. Met with flight instructor for an hour to review the flight using flightaware.com and my notes and recollection. When the downdraft dropped and rolled the plane, I was not sure we would make it. She said only thing she would have done differently than I did was to declare an emergency. Weather was changing. Thunderstorms were forecast later in the day. No reports at the time of takeoff. My wife, after we landed, did tell me that off to our right was a dark large cloud. Yet, clouds in front of me had diffuse sun light. All that I know is that after shortly being over the ocean it was like hitting a brick wall. Had latest weather information; but, clearly was insufficient. Not sure how to improve surface and low level weather predictions on the coast.","","250, 789, 2150","4400",FALSE
"216","Coming in on the arrival we were vectored off at least a dozen times. After going south of the airport then on an extended downwind, we were finally given a heading to intercept the LOC. After we began to capture the LOC the controllers were giving us some speed tolerances and at around 25+ miles our plane began a severe right turn breaking off the LOC. At about the same time it became obvious the approach controller asked where we were going. I pulled the heading knob and began a left turn back. Once established on a heading I reengaged the LOC, at the same time the controller came on and told us to maintain 160 kts and the LOC broke off again, this time towards the left. Again I switched to heading mode and with the winds at altitude being out of the southwest at around 45 knots it took a great deal to get back on course. A final attempt was made to engage the approach again but again this time it started a hard right turn, I disengaged the auto pilot and began flying the plane and using raw data to regain the LOC and GS. I believe somewhere outside of [the FAF] we were completely established and unfortunately had a scud layer at about 1000 ft to go through before making visual contact with the runway. The raw data was working but the auto pilot was not responding correctly, and unfortunately due to the issues at hand we didn't get the opportunity to try the other AP.Because of the stress of the weather for the night and due to a long flight, combined with the constant vectoring and speed changes, I cannot completely say it was not an operator issue. I do know that any time the AP was engaged for the approach it vectored off and that when I hand flew it with the flight director it worked fine. Again I would like to have had the opportunity to try the other AP, I truly believe it was a mechanical malfunction. I'm not really sure how this could have been prevented beforehand but it certainly gets the attention in my book to kick off the auto pilot more often and just fly the plane.","","1000","4000",FALSE
"220","Approximately 10-15 mins after takeoff we encountered severe turbulence between 27,000-30,000 ft. Duration was approximately 5 mins. It was the worst turbulence I have encountered in my 30 plus years of flying. Location was close to the shoreline, as our routing on departure from ZZZ had us flying north for a bit, before being turned east, to cross the water. There had been no other aircraft on our frequencies mentioning severe turbulence. There was no convective activity in the area, although very high winds on the ground and aloft, associated with a cold front. The seat belt sign was turned on, passengers were all seated. The flight attendants in the back had just gotten their carts out to begin their service. Severe turbulence began without warning. The FB had just gone back to business class to begin his break. Both CA and FO had our hands full to maintain aircraft control. FO was pilot flying. We disconnected Auto Pilot and Auto Throttles, and attempted to climb out of the turbulence. It took us longer than expected, due to previously mentioned lack of complete aircraft control. Airspeed loss was approximately 60 knots, from 310 down to 250 before airspeed decay was arrested and a climb to smooth air was accomplished. Once we leveled at 310 and were out of the turbulence and building airspeed, I took over ATC communications and the CA handled the cabin. The Captain was informed of the cabin injuries and immediately [advised ATC] and directed a return to ZZZ. The FB remained in the cabin to help with the injured crew members. One woman had a head wound and the other, who was more seriously injured, had a flying full food service cart land on her. As soon as injured were as stable as possible, FB returned to cockpit to aid in our emergency return. We were all concerned that we might descend thru the turbulence area, so we flew south for 30 miles or so, before turning back west towards ZZZ. We were able to miss the turbulence on descent. We were going to be overweight by about 20,000 lbs, so we accomplished the Over Weight Landing checklist. We radioed ops and had ambulances waiting for us at gate. We asked for, and received, clearance to straight in ILS to Runway XXR. Weather was clear and wind was well within limits. Uneventful approach and landing on the long runway, with minimal brake usage, due to overweight condition. ZZZ ATC was outstanding through the entire event, enroute, approach and tower and ground at ZZZ.Arrived at gate, passengers remained seated to allow EMTs to get to rear of aircraft. Injured crew safely removed and passengers allowed to deplane. Many frightened, scared passengers. Cabin crew was injured, very emotionally upset, but still performed their duties admirably. The three of us pilots were very keyed-up and over-loaded on adrenaline after what we had been through, and after a brief, closed door conference, the three of us decided that we were not mentally or physically fit for duty to fly an 8 hour flight across the Atlantic into forecast heavy winds over in England, with possible missed approach and/or diversion. The Captain handled the communication with crew tracking and the chief pilot. We then went down to operations and spent the next 30-45 minutes winding down and reviewing our flight. The longer we talked the more convinced I was that we were making a wise decision in not continuing that evening.","We were about 30 minutes into our flight and I had just sat down in the cabin to start my break when we encountered severe turbulence. It lasted anywhere from 5-10 minutes. After the worst of it had passed I noticed our purser rushing through the cabin to the aft part of the aircraft. I curiously followed her and found [three] FA's injured in the back galley with a galley cart laying on its side and its content spilling out. I then returned to the flight deck to assist in coordinating our emergency arrival with ramp, dispatch and maintenance. After an uneventful landing, we were expedited to the gate. Next came firemen, paramedics, ambulances and police officers along with crying passengers and injured and upset FAs. At this point there was some discussion about getting a 767 and new FAs available to continue flight but nobody had a time frame set. The three of us then decided, per our Human Factors guidance, to discuss our ability to perform our duties safely going forward after an adrenaline producing event like the one we had just incurred and came to the conclusion that we were probably more affected than we cared to admit at that point. Looking at the weather both at ZZZ and the potential of similar weather at the destination according to the forecast, along with not knowing when an aircraft and crew would be ready, we decided after another 20-30 min. discussion that it wouldn't be in the best interest of safety for us to continue with [the] flight. We had all been under a great deal of stress and were all starting to feel a little overwhelmed. At that point, we returned to operations and spent the next 45 minutes discussing what had happened and decompressing. We didn't get any reports of severe turbulence and while we had heard reports of turbulence, none of them reached the point we experienced. Perhaps we could have kept the FAs seated a little longer but as mentioned there were no prior indications of turbulence of even close to this magnitude.","250, 310, 30000","27000",FALSE
"221","Approximately 10-15 mins after takeoff we encountered severe turbulence between 27,000- 30,000 feet. Duration was approximately 5 minutes. It was the worst turbulence I have encountered in my 35 years of flying.There had been no other aircraft on our frequencies mentioning severe turbulence. There was no convective activity in the area, although very high winds on the ground and aloft, associated with a cold front. The seat belt sign was turned on, passengers were all seated. The flight attendants in the back had just got their carts out to begin their service. Severe turbulence began without warning. The [Relief Officer] had just gone back to business class to begin his break. Both Captain and First Officer (FO) had our hands full to maintain aircraft control. FO was pilot flying. We disconnected Auto Pilot and Auto Throttles, and attempted to climb out of the turbulence. It took us longer than expected, due to previously mentioned lack of complete aircraft control. Airspeed loss was approximately 60 knots, from 310 down to 250 before airspeed decay was arrested and a climb to smooth air was accomplished when aircraft was safely under control.I immediately called the cabin on interphone to assess. I heard crying and reports of multiple seriously injured flight attendants. I immediately asked for return to the departure airport. The [Relief Officer] remained in the cabin to help with the injured crew members. One women had a head wound and the other, who was more seriously injured, had a flying full food service cart land on her. As soon as injured were as stable as possible, [Relief Officer] returned to cockpit to aid in our return. I was concerned with descending back thru the turbulence area, so we flew south for 30 miles or so, before turning back west towards the departure airport. We were able to miss the turbulence on descent. We were going to be over weight by about 20,000 lbs, so we accomplished the Over Weight Landing checklist. We radioed ops and had ambulances waiting for us at gate.We asked for, and received, clearance to straight in ILS. Weather was clear and wind was well within limits. Uneventful approach and landing on the long runway, with minimal brake usage, due to over weight condition. ATC was outstanding through the entire event, enroute, approach, tower and ground. Arrived at gate, passengers remained seated to allow EMTs to get to rear of aircraft. Injured crew safely removed and passengers allowed to deplane. Many frightened, scared passengers. Cabin crew was injured, very emotionally upset, but still performed their duties admirably.The three of us pilots were very keyed-up and over-loaded on adrenaline after what we had been thru, and after a brief, closed door conference, the three of us decided that we were not mentally or physically fit for duty to fly an 8 hour flight forecast into heavy winds with possible missed approach and/or diversion. Along with the outstanding cabin crew, I would like to commend my two FOs. They were invaluable to the safe completion of this flight.","","250, 310, 30000","27000",FALSE
"224","I was the pilot flying on a delayed flight to LGA. The weather in LGA was marginal all day with low ceilings, rain and gusty winds. The two prior flights to ours had cancelled and the two flights after us cancelled as well. Our aircraft arrived late and we spent close to an hour in the awaiting our EDCT. We held for close 40 minutes just 5 minutes shy of diverting to AVP or JFK. We were vectored for ILS 13 to LGA and were informed of PIREPs reporting speed gains and losses of up to 15 knots on final. With the speed fluctuations, I instructed the FO (pilot monitoring) to watch my speed. At 1000 feet MSL we experienced the reported speed gains and losses of 15kts a couple times. We were in IMC, it was raining heavily and the wipers were on high - cockpit noise was high. I kept the AP and AT's on as I transitioned from 'inside the cockpit' to 'outside - flying visually' as the FO called the runway -'in sight!' [At] 600-700 feet [AGL] I got visual of the runway. Prior to the '500 foot call out' we got the wind shear warning. The warning lasted just a few seconds and my speed fluctuated only 10-12kts. By the time I realized what had happened the warning went away, we were still on glide path, localizer and the speed was under control. I continued the approach and landed safely. We discussed what had happened after the flight and both agreed that I should have initiated the wind shear recovery procedure. The FO said he prompted me to initiate the recovery procedure but I didn't hear it at the time. I realized what had happened too late and it was over so quick. I never actually heard the 3 wind shear audible warnings. This was my first wind shear warning on landing, outside the simulator.Be more proactive and vigilant when it comes to wind shear events. Brief recovery procedures prior to takeoff and landing, when wind shear warnings/PIREPs exist.","We experienced gains and losses of 5 to 10 knots for the first portion of the approach. The Captain was overriding the autothrottles the entire time, but he was able to keep the airspeed fluctuations to a minimum. We experienced at least one loss of about 15 knots at about 1,000 feet. When we switched to the tower frequency, we were told that the preceding aircraft reported a loss of 15 knots at 500 feet. When we were about 500 feet, we experienced a momentary loss of about 12 knots. The Captain quickly brought the power up, and the airspeed immediately recovered. Moments later, and after the speed recovered, we received a windshear warning. The warning surprised both of us because it occurred after the event. Regardless, I said, 'firewall thrust, go around,' but he did not go around. At this time, I remember looking at the instrument panel, and the aircraft was on speed, established, and on glide path; it was as if nothing happened. The Captain continued the approach, and we landed without incident. After we got on the ground, we discussed what happened. We both agreed that we should have gone around, despite the fact that the airspeed recovered so quickly. The Captain told me that he thought it was a windshear caution and he should have listened to me; I told him that I needed to speak up.In training, the difference between a windshear caution and warning should be emphasized and practiced more than once during each recurrent sim session. In addition, it should be stressed that whenever any flight crewmember calls a go around, it should be immediately executed without hesitation.","500, 700, 1000","600",TRUE
"237","May have busted level off altitude due to wake turbulence from preceding Airbus and/or moderate to severe turbulence on the climb out, just south of high terrain, wind gusts. Departed from VNY to the north (runway 34), very turbulent on the climb out, frequency very busy, unable to communicate with ATC and I had a pressurization issue which needed to be corrected compounding the potential altitude bust, but was immediately cleared direct to Gorman, 'climb and maintain 10,000 feet' so I sensed the controller knew the conditions as well.","","10000","4000",FALSE
"240","When on final to runway XX, tower reported winds 190/40G60 and cleared us to land.  Configuration at that time was gear down and flaps 20.  Up to that point and on descent from FL290, the autopilot had tremendous difficulty in controlling the aircraft due to the turbulence.  It could not find and capture the localizer due to the 65 knots of cross wind at altitude.  I elected to hand fly the aircraft to final and reengaged the autopilot.  I called for the flaps 1 and flaps 5 to be extended, called for gear down and then flaps 20.  I set the correct speed for flaps 20.  The aircraft was having an extremely difficult time trying to control the aircraft accurately approaching the final approach fix.  Speed was 20-25 knots above the selected speed.  I disconnected the autopilot and found it impossible to maintain consistent wings level and the proper pitch attitude to maintain glide path.  All parameters were fluid and temporary.  I discussed briefly with the First Officer (FO) the possibility of landing with flaps 20 due to my concern with controlling the aircraft attitude in view of the 40 gusting to 60 knots of wind, even thought it was only 30 degrees from runway heading.  After discussing the merits of a flaps 20 landing, we added 20 knots to the flaps 20 ref speed (125 knots for our weight) and selected 145 as our reference.  I also instructed the FO to select the flap override switch to 'override' to eliminate the nuisance flap/terrain call.  Other than the gusting winds and being very difficult to control, the remaining portion of the approach to touchdown was, all things considered, uneventful and uncomfortable.  It wasn't until I was in the hotel room that I decided to look at the 757 AOM to determine if my 'procedures' were in fact compatible with the 757, as they were with other aircraft I've flown.  I cannot find any provision in the AOM that permits or prohibits landing with flaps 20 in extremely strong and gusty winds.  I apparently, and inadvertently, landed in a flap configuration contrary to 757 AOM procedures.  Next time in this situation (for which I don't recall ever training to, wind 40G60) I will use the full 30 degree flap setting, or if it becomes uncontrollable, I will divert.","","29000","6000",FALSE
"243","Arriving from the oceanic sector into the SF Bay Area. I was both Pilot Flying (PF) and PIC. My iPad, used for approach chart data, froze. I could not scale or change charts. OAK (destination) had originally reported calm wind and 10 sm visibility and I was going to use the RNAV-Y 28L. The updated weather placed TRW over the airport and the wind was 15 gusting to 35, visibility 1 sm in heavy rain, so I was trying to shift to the ILS 30. As it was a round trip to OAK, we had three pilots in the cockpit and the other 2 had functioning iPads. I switched with the third pilot in the jump seat and had a functioning iPad quickly. This is our home base, we are all VERY familiar with the approach, but wanted it displayed to follow proper SOP's.As we crossed the OSI VOR, the Pilot Monitoring (PM)/SIC pointed to the altitude alerter which he had set to 6,000 feet per received NORMAL clearance. I did not realize that we were still at 7,000' and ATC had called a second time telling us to descend. There was no immediate conflict. No evasive maneuvering was taken or noted by any aircraft or ATC. We descended as instructed but may have delayed our descent by 30 seconds due to my distraction with the iPad.Subsequent to this, I contacted Jeppesen, the manufacturer of the software used in the iPad. They noted it was a known problem, they were working on a revision and provided a workaround in the meantime. The workaround was transmitted that evening to all company pilots to prevent further problems until a software fix is released.","","6000","7000",FALSE
"248","On arrival we were cleared for the approach. As PM I read back 'turn right 200 degrees maintain 2,000 till established cleared for the ILS approach'. Just outside the initial approach fix, ATC informed us of a low altitude alert and were told to climb back up to 3,000 feet. Once there we were re-cleared for the ILS approach. No further incidents.I would say that fatigue was the primary culprit. When we read back the clearance it should have seemed an unusual altitude to intercept at, as the minimum altitude at the IAF is 2,600 feet. Also when I received the clearance there was chatter on guard 121.5 which could have interfered with hearing our clearance correctly.","","2600, 3000","2000",FALSE
