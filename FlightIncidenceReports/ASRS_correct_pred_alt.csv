"11","Departing SJC, clearance gave us the TECKY1 RNAV departure. Upon reviewing the departure and reading the 30R initial climb instructions, we had put in the routing instruction altitude of FL190. Our failure came primarily because of the assumption that waypoint SPTNS was an 'at or above 5,000 feet' altitude as opposed to 'cross at' altitude.We were in IMC conditions after rotation and were being bounced around a bit by a 767 heavy wake that departed in front of us, and that kind of flustered us.  Other than that, conditions were calm.The altitude deviation was exacerbated by the pilot flying making the assumption that we were under class B airspace and could only fly at 200 knots, so the aircraft being relatively light and at full power was climbing at well over 3,000 feet per minute. When tower handed us off to departure, I did check in verbally that we were 2,000 feet climbing FL190. Within 3 minutes after departure, ATC told us to stop climb at around 7,000 feet and not to climb until passing waypoint SPTNS. I do believe that a transition to a faster climb speed would have probably made us cross SPTNS at 5000 feet.I did manage to call NorCal ATC when we arrived.  They did say that this is a new departure with the restrictions and are experiencing some growing pains with it. I guess my first suggestion would be to have Clearance assign the initial altitude. My other suggestion would be to put an alert box with the information sign on the TECKY1 like they have on the SJC9 departure plate. That is very easy to see and quickly identify. The SJC9 also has the maintain altitude at 5,000 feet and then also in bold letters.  This would be very helpful print on the TECKY1.The TECKY1 RNAV is a very simple looking departure and I think that CRM was lagging a bit because of that as well. As pilots I think we are a little more paranoid when we see many step climbs and altitude restrictions on departure or arrival plates. In retrospect I think both pilots should have read the departure out loud.","Misinterpretation of SID (TECKY ONE RNAV DEPARTURE)SJC is underneath SFO class B airspace (starts at 8000 ft.), climbing at 200 KIAS and combination of IMC, minimum safe altitude of 5600 msl, 19000 as transition altitude, resulted in crossing SPTNS fix at higher altitude than what's depicted in the SID. 19000 as initial altitude seemed logic since you want to get away from mountains surrounding airport as soon as you can. I should have asked clearance delivery to explain that clearance since it was pretty new. (Only [a few] weeks out) On initial check in with departure Pilot Monitoring stated 'CALL SIGN, 1200 climbing 19000', ATC acknowledged.Clearance delivery should state 'climb via SID except maintain 5000' so there is no misinterpretation is it 5000 or 19000 ft. as initial altitude.","200, 1200, 2000, 3000, 5000, 5600, 7000, 8000, 19000","19000","7000",FALSE
"12","While proceeding southbound on AR24, approaching OHLAA intersection, there was a line of weather running southwest to northeast across the airway, for which we requested and received a clearance to deviate towards the East, and to proceed direct to URSUS intersection afterwards. The controller reported to us, and other aircraft on the frequency, that around that area of weather there was reported moderate turbulence from FL320 all the way up to FL360 or FL380, I cannot recall but we were about to hit that area. Being downwind of the weather, with the wind at around 63 knots out of the southwest and the reported turbulence, we decided to take a wide deviation to try to be as clear as possible of any eddies and/or downwind turbulence we may encounter, on top of the already reported moderate turbulence. Throughout the deviation we experienced 3 pockets, of about 10 seconds each, of moderate turbulence, while experiencing continuous light turbulence; most of it was due to erratic wind speed and direction changes inside the reported area. While deviating, the controller became worried that we were leaving radar coverage, and asked us how far or how long before we could turn on course to URSUS. I was still deviating, although we didn't have that much to go, and I told him that we had about another twenty miles before we could turn on course. He said that he was not painting any weather and I needed to turn to a heading of 220, I believe, to which I replied that we were unable to do so, that the most I could turn in about a minute would be a heading of 200 or 210, I cannot recall. He said he understood that I was using my PIC's emergency authority to not comply with an ATC instruction, to which I replied that that was affirmative. A minute later we were clear of the weather and we turned towards URSUS, letting the controller know we were done deviating. It is worth mentioning that while we were deviating, we could see on our Navigation Display's TCAS information, that there were a number of airplanes inside the area of weather we were painting, and where the controller said he wasn't painting anything. Those same airplanes were reporting moderate turbulence, so strong, we could actually hear the voice of the pilot talking, jumping around and changing tone due to the jolts they were experiencing. There was no way I was going to turn the aircraft any sooner towards URSUS. One, we were painting weather, and Two, those guys to our right were getting an awful ride, while ours was manageable. I'll also like to add that the controller was very professional and courteous throughout the event, not just to us, but to all aircraft deviating.","","32000, 36000, 38000","32000","36000",FALSE
"16","Were cleared for Visual Rwy 01 at ZZZ. At about 600 feet AGL, experienced a 15 knot airspeed loss accompanied by Windshear Warning. Executed windshear escape maneuver. Notified ATC of windshear and going around.Tower told us to climb to 2000 feet and intercept ZZZ 328 radial. Exiting windshear at about 1200 AGL with max thrust, a light airplane, and a cold night, we had a correspondingly significant climb rate and were unable to level at 2000 feet. We peaked at 2400 feet before descending to our assigned altitude.I called Tower and said that we were returning to our assigned altitude. We completed the required checklists and returned for another visual approach to Rwy 01. Tower advised that subsequent aircraft had not experienced significant windshear. We completed an uneventful approach and landing. Maintenance was notified of the windshear escape maneuver and told that we were not aware of any engine exceedances or gear/flap overspeeds.","","328, 600, 1200, 2000, 2400","2000","2400",FALSE
"18","While flying enroute we requested a climb to FL410 to stay above weather along our route. However, the airplane recently transferred ownership so it was not RVSM approved. We advised ATC prior to our climb, and they cleared us to climb non RVSM to FL410. After we switched controllers a few times, Washington Center asked us to climb to FL430. While in the climb, we noticed our performance deteriorating as we approached the maximum ceiling for the aircraft (FL450). We constantly advised approach that we would need more time to make the climb, and they were fine with the slow climb. Upon reaching our cruise altitude of FL430, the airspeed began dropping and we were only climbing at 100 feet per minute. As we began to level off, the autopilot disengaged and we experienced stick shaker for the first indication of a stall. The pilot flying lowered the nose to prevent a stall, and the aircraft descended 800 feet in the recovery. At this point, we requested FL420 or FL410, but the controller denied it. When we requested a descent to FL280, the controller requested a turn 20 degrees left, but we couldn't turn very quickly with the imminent stall situation. Therefore, we took the turn slowly to be safe.Contributing Factors - the captain had never flown above Fl410 before and high altitude flight/stalls had never been discussed in any of his training. This was my first trip in the Beechjet since I completed my training. Almost all of my training was performed in a simulator below 10,000 feet at low speed flight. Not only was I nervous and overwhelmed with my first trip, but I didn't know what to expect.Actions - The captain noticed the stall indication and immediately reacted accordingly. As the PM, I notified ATC immediately.Inactions - both of us failed to realize that our poor climb performance would affect our ability to level off, maintain altitude, and cruise in turbulence at high altitude.","About 10 minutes later the controller asked us if we were able to climb to FL430. We responded that we 'needed a few more minutes at FL410'. Eventually we were asked to climb. Initially the aircraft climb was acceptable, but passing FL420 we were unable to maintain 500 fpm in the climb. As we were leveling at FL430 we encountered turbulence, the airspeed began decreasing, and a stall was imminent. I asked the non-flying pilot to advice ATC that we had to descend immediately due to inability to maintain airspeed and we would take vectors if necessary.Our airspeed was still not increasing rapidly so I initiated a very shallow banked turn. ATC asked why we weren't turning fast enough etc. we were given a number to call. Upon landing at our destination, I contacted the ARTCC manager as advised. He was very nice and explained that we needed to keep them apprised in the future if the aircraft could not perform as expected. He said everything was 'ok'.","500, 800, 10000, 28000, 41000, 42000, 43000, 45000","41000","43000",FALSE

Next was a frequency change to Atlanta Center and was cleared to descend VIA the IVANE5.  We set altitude alerter to 6000 feet for the bottom restriction on the IVAN5 STAR.  The FMS decided to drop the flight restriction of FL240 at MAYOS fix all by itself.  The aircraft began to descend to FL220 looking at the next restriction of KIYEN. Next call was from Atlanta Center asking what altitude are you descending to? We were just passing 23,500 feet. It was too late to intervene and make the FL240 restriction at MAYOS. We were instructed to descend to FL220 by Atlanta Center and missed the restriction of FL240.  We asked ATC if there was a conflict with traffic and none was noted at this time. There is a corridor that has passing traffic below FL240 at MAYOS.

"27","I had just returned from my rest break and the First Officer (FO) and International Relief Officer (IRO) had climbed to FL360 in an attempt to find a smoother ride. At the time we had been in constant light turbulence with an occasional moderate bump. We were advised that we could find a smooth ride at FL240. After contacting Center we asked for clearance to FL240. As we descended through FL290 the ride improved considerably. As we passed through FL250 we encountered a small area of precipitation followed by a single severe bump. Both weather radars were on and there was not any weather painting. The IRO called to the Flight Attendants (FA) to see if they were OK. The lead told him that some of the FAs in the rear of the cabin had been hurt. After realizing there were injuries we declared an emergency and proceeded directly to the airport. Dispatch was notified and coordinated for medical personnel to meet at the gate.The fasten seatbelt sign had been on for quite some time prior to beginning descent.

"29","At cruise FL340, we encountered fumes that smelled like electrical wiring burning, or a motor burning up. Having experienced this on a 767, I recognized the smell, but it was worse, and in that previous incident it was a cargo exhaust fan that failed and disconnected itself. Actions -We first donned our oxygen masks, confirmed Oxygen on 100% and my First Officer (FO) immediately got the smoke/ fumes QRH out and started to accomplish the checklist items. We were in Moderate turbulence, and IMC at this time, autopilot/autoflight systems on. Turbulence was causing altitude deviations of +/- 100 feet. Previous to this, since we were in IMC, we checked the OAT which was -36C so we turned on engine and wing anti-ice. We did not fly over or near any radar returns of yellow or red.  Several calls from the flight attendants (FA) indicated the presence of substantial electrical odor in the cabin, and it was significant. Passenger Flight attendant call buttons were going off in large quantity. We immediately were thinking about a return to the departure airport. Substantial thunderstorm activity was along our route and we were immediately thinking how to break track if this didn't improve immediately. Moments later, we lost our Mach Airspeed indicators, which spun down, our speed tapes dropped to minimum speed, and the auto throttles advanced along with an immediate stick shaker. We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however I was immediately task focused on flying the airplane. [Past aircraft accidents] came to mind. I disconnected the auto throttles, autopilot and hand flew the jet, referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly. We had no reliable airspeed indications and a stick shaker, in Moderate turbulence in IMC.  I added thrust, as I was fighting Moderate turbulence, and flying wings level and a relative known pitch, and with virtually no airspeed references, I resorted to an approximate known fuel flow of about 4000Lbs/engine and pitch slightly above the Horizon. (Knowing cruise would also be about 1.55 EPR and pitch 2.5-3.5).We [advised our situation] on 121.5. Got a response from several aircraft, one was helpful and relayed our position and [situation] to Oceanic on HF Radio. I turned right to break off of the track, and was having to navigate between thunderstorms the best I could while in IMC. Knowing that ideal would be to get to 15NM parallel track, however with all the weather, I believed other aircraft may be deviating this distance left and right of track, and 15NM Right/South of track was not possible with the weather. 25-30 miles or halfway between tracks probably would be safer in such an emergency, and with no airspeed references.  My FO was accomplishing the QRH Smoke Fumes checklist and checked with me prior to turning the left Recirc fan off, which changes many things to vent any smoke/fumes, and since we were already diverting, I nodded and said yes, do it. We flew approximately 20-30 miles off to the Right/South and set up a direct to the departure airport which the ALTN page showed as the nearest airport.  We set up FL240 in the MCP Altitude window.  I started a gentle descent, as aircraft controllability was of significant concern without reliable airspeed indications. Turbulence was still BRUTAL. Airspeed indications came back and were lost 3 different times, and I adjusted power based on what we had. Additionally I was having substantial right engine vibration of 5.0, and while I had no airspeed indications. Still in solid IMC, I was trying to differentiate between unrelenting turbulence, the stick shaker, engine vibration possibly due to ice crystal icing, and possibly airframe vibration/buffet possibly due to higher Mach speed (by feel) to which I reduced thrust gently to combat. I resorted to an approximate fuel flow and pitch as often as I could. We closed the right engine (#2) bleed, and opened the isolation valve in the event that the fumescould have been partially coming from the Right engine, since its N1 Vibration was at 5.0, which was Amber in color. This did not have an effect on the fumes on the airplane. My knowledge of the Ice Crystal Icing procedures above FL250 was to have Engine Anti Ice ON (already was on) and avoid suspected conditions (we already were trying to get out of it). We were task saturated.  Mindset - When we initially got the electrical smoke/fumes/smell during the high level of turbulence followed by the loss of all airspeed indications, since we weren't flying over any yellow or red radar echoes, had no moisture indications on the windshield, no sulfur smell, my thought immediately went to a chaffed electrical harness supplying heating to Pitot/Static and possible other systems, which may have been the source of airspeed indication failures, rather than Ice Crystal Icing causing Airspeed/Mach Indication losses, and the electrical fumes were very strong.  My FO had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating, so we did not choose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist. My thoughts were to get off track far enough to avoid deviating aircraft, reverse course and descend to lower altitude both to safely get below the tracks, below the headwinds, other aircraft, and possibly out of the IMC so as to resolve any icing issue if we had a partially heated system, out of the turbulence to stop any electrical wiring chaffing and into VMC to help fly the airplane with more references, and less task saturation. After established heading back at FL240, an approximate speed of 280 knots indicated, Airspeed indications which had returned had stabilized and I was able to engage an autopilot and autoflight systems. The Engine Vibration indications (N1) were normal and not indicated in Amber. At this point we were able to talk with ATC and complete a phone patch with our company Dispatch and Maintenance folks. I explained the Fumes, the loss of Airspeed indications, the Right Engine vibration, etc. and was headed back. We contacted Approach with our position and were given FL240. They provided us a SQUAWK and cleared us direct. We reassessed the cabin situation, and I gave the passengers a PA explaining what we had, as far as the electrical smell/smoke concern and our decision to return. I did not explain the flight instrument failures or vibration issues, as this was not of concern to the passengers and would have been of no benefit to them. We eventually were provided landing data, which showed us possibly landing a couple of thousand pounds over structural landing weight but well under performance limits. My thoughts were to reassess the condition of the smoke/fumes as we got closer to the airport and determine if two slight further airports may be a better option. As we got closer, an assessment of the conditions indicated that all things were stable, no increasing smoke/fumes were being generated and while time was important, things weren't dire. The flight attendants indicated that the level of fumes would come and go but weren't increasing at this time. The weather at our destination was rapidly deteriorating, winds down the runway at close to 40Kts, as were in one of our optional airport, but the visibility at our destination was at 1 mile, mostly due to rain, which was below the Cat C landing minimums and reported to be deteriorating in rain. That was no longer suitable. The other two airports were the same in time, and with the fact that winds were high and one airport had one runway, I didn't want to get in the possible situation of some aircraft getting disabled on the runway there and us having to go to the third airport anyway, so the decision was made to go to the largest of our alternative. An uneventful landing was made and we taxied to the gate, followed by emergency vehicles as they were examining our aircraft continually. At the gate the fireman looked for my thumbs up and he returned the same and we completed our parking checklist.","We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however we were immediately task saturated and focused on flying the airplane. The Captain disconnected the autothrottles, autopilot and hand flew the jet. We were both referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly. We had no reliable airspeed indications, a stick shaker, in Moderate turbulence, all in addition to being IMC. The Captain was flying the best he could, which was fantastic; using known pitch and fuel flow settings to maintain altitude and airspeed. Our altimeters seemed to be accurate.I had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical-burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating, so we did not chose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist. We also decided to keep the aircraft cold since passengers were getting motion sick. Our thoughts were to get off track far enough to avoid deviating aircraft, reverse course and descend to lower altitude both to safely get below the tracks, below the headwinds, other aircraft, and possibly out of the IMC so as to resolve any icing issue. Not to mention, getting relief from turbulence, which may help to stop any electrical wiring chaffing, and into VMC to help fly the airplane with more references. After established a heading back at FL240, at 280kts indicated, the airspeed indications, which had returned, had stabilized and the Captain was able to engage the autopilot and auto-flight systems.","24000, 25000, 34000","24000","34000",FALSE
"31","Approximately at X Airway we encountered what I would term continuous moderate occasional severe turbulence.  We had previously sat the passengers down when we had light turbulence and we instructed the flight attendants to be seated immediately via PA.  Captain and Flying First officer were in bunk on their sleep shift.  We left the autopilot hooked up to help with control but the typical slow throttle corrections had me overriding the thrust settings to keep us out of the over speed and stall regions.  We were initially at FL370 but requested climb to FL390 as we thought we may get out of the turbulence because of the forecast (FL310-370) although this forecast ended about X Airway.  Optimal according to the FMC was approximately FL390.  When we finally attained clearance (CPDLC) and climbed it was actually worse and only reduced our margins.  The whole event was probably 10-15 minutes.  Aircraft control was maintained although the Auto Pilot was having a difficult time maintaining level flight.  I was ready to take over if it kicked off but felt overall it helped to have the Auto Pilot on.  We then asked for FL350 but it took over 3 minutes to get this approved (CPDLC and HF).  The biggest threat I felt was the airspeed changes with violent wind shifts and different velocity of the wind.  We never had an over speed although we were close many times but we had it go into the slow range above stall many times and I was concerned about stalling out this aircraft several times.  Near the end of the event we had the low hydraulic quantity #1 EICAS.  By the time we got to the checklist though we had lost all fluid and pressure (couple minutes with altitude changes, reports to HF, VHF for aircraft behind us, etc).  When this happened my Auto Pilot kicked off but I changed to the left Auto Pilot as well as my source select switch for the Flight Director.  We alerted the Captain to come out of the bunk area and we handled the resulting checklists and landed uneventfully at our destination [which was] also the nearest suitable airport.

"36","Aircraft X, a PHX departure was climbing out on the SNOBL departure climbing to FL360. Due to a ZLA LOA requirement, I also had 4 KLAS arrivals descending to FL300. I noticed that Aircraft X was an issue with the last of the KLAS arrivals, and turned Aircraft X 15 degrees right, to fall behind. During the shift we had bad rides anywhere from light chop to moderate chop to moderate turbulence. Aircraft Y who was further east entered the airspace at FL340. Halfway through the sector (about 5 minutes prior to turning Aircraft X), Aircraft Y asked for a better altitude, I had then stated that I no complaints at FL300. Aircraft Y asked for FL300 and I descended the aircraft.While Aircraft X began his turn, I noticed that Aircraft Y was also traffic, and was planning to get Aircraft X on course at the earliest time. I cleared Aircraft X on course, and had he done the turn right there, this would be a non-issue. Aircraft X slopped his turn (possibly due to the winds) and I recognized that I was not going to have separation with the current status (just slightly over 2 minutes out). I called ZLA and APPREQED Aircraft Y descending to FL280 for traffic, they said approved. I keyed up to issues the descent, 'Aircraft Y descend and maintain FL280 for traffic.' I believe I issued a 2,000 feet per minute descent rate (I know this is not 'valid' but I know that it helps convey a rate needed, and is used as an advisory). I waited, and received no response. I keyed up and said the same thing, then waited, no response. I keyed up a 3rd time and issued the descent. After the 3rd call, Aircraft Y asked if I was calling him. I said yes, then issued the clearance for the 4th time. The pilot waited a second, then responded with, 'Can you confirm the altitude for Aircraft Y?' I reissued the clearance, and told the aircraft to expedite and that I needed him 'Out of 29 in a minute of less.' Aircraft Y waited a second, then read back the clearance. I then told Aircraft X to expedite his climb and to report out of FL310. At that point, Aircraft Y said that he had the traffic in sight, 'Traffic in sight 6 miles in front 400 feet above.' And Aircraft X on his own said he had the 4 o'clock traffic. Aircraft X was at FL305 climbing, Aircraft Y level at FL300, 2 hits later, I lost separation at circa 4.8 miles, the next hit was around 4 miles, I saw as close as 3.75 nm between the targets.All the time, ZLA had the hand off on Aircraft Y, after APPREQING the descent, ZLA never changed the data block. I know that around 3.75 miles I had 1,000+ feet, because I finally saw Aircraft Y out of FL295. But I cannot tell you what I really had. After Aircraft X was out of FL295, ZLA changed the data block to reflect FL280.I firmly believe that I would have had separation had Aircraft Y responded to the first clearance. It took 5 transmissions to get the clearance to Aircraft Y (in my opinion that is unacceptable). My back up plan was to descend Aircraft Y. I went to execute the backup plan and Aircraft Y didn't listen. I really feel that I let the ATC system down. I trusted that the pilots would listen and follow directions. I have had a handful of close calls in my career, but up to this point, I maintained separation because the pilots responded on the first call. This situation really caught me off guard. I didn't expect so much effort to relay a descent clearance to Aircraft Y. I am truly sorry. I could have stopped Aircraft X at FL280 and never climbed him above the traffic. But I was trying to provide the best service possible. And providing that service caught me.Having pilots that listen.

"38","On descent into ATL, we were given holding instructions, to reduce speed, and hold (on either the LGC or HONIE intersection) radial, as published at FL180. Due to a low altimeter setting, less than 29.92, I queried my First Officer (FO) to ask ATC to reaffirm our holding altitude. After doing so, and with numerous aircraft receiving clearances, the ATC controller, seeming somewhat agitated, restated that we were instructed to hold at FL180. I instructed my FO that this was an unacceptable FL due to the altimeter setting and to advise ATC. Unfortunately, due to numerous arrivals and simultaneous ILS PRM approaches in use, we were not able to advise ATC of the unacceptable clearance. At this time, we were descending on the arrival, and entering the hold. Slowing, and turning while entering the hold, alpha protection started climbing on our PFDs. Noticing this, my FO called out 'airspeed'. I responded to his callout, looked at my altimeter, believing I was passing through 18,700 and called for 'flaps one'. He checked his altimeter and positioned the flap handle in flaps one position. At this time, knowing the max flaps extension altitude being 20,000 feet, we both believed and confirmed that we were within aircraft limitations.Although aircraft saturation and weather were a significant factor, what appeared to be an ATC controller unaware that FL180 is unusable with a local altimeter setting of less than 29.92, added to the confusion, not only in communications, saturated approach control frequency, but the workload in the cockpit of transitioning from the descent phase to the approach phase. ATC must limit speed restrictions in the flight levels to nothing less than 250kts IAS.","","18000, 18700, 20000","18000","20000",FALSE

After setting max cruise power and still unable to maintain speed (at this point we had bled off about 10-15 knots of speed) I told the First Officer to notify Center that we would like to descend to FL320.  Because of the convective storm we were flying through, and radios were completely garbled, and we were unable to communicate.  I elected to start to descend to FL320 without ATC clearance after losing another 15 knots and within 20 knots of the lower foot.  At FL 330 we were able to talk to ATC and they gave us clearance to continue our descent to FL320.Possible mountain wave activity","Our airspeed dropped by over 40 knots indicated, putting us close to a possible aerodynamic stall.

"53","Enroute on an empty reposition leg, we encountered severe turbulence and mountain wave near ALS. Aircraft began to climb in excess of 1000 fpm and accelerate near red line despite us slowing in anticipation to M .76. Upon acceleration I quickly went to idle thrust, and then deployed the boards to 1/4. At that time the plane began to encounter the turbulence. The plane banked to what looked like near or slightly over 30 degrees left and was rattled by heavy jolts of turbulence at the same time. The other pilot helped by grabbing the ailerons at which time we worked as a team. He tried to keep the wings level and descend as I adjusted power and boards to keep plane at a safe speed. We advised ATC of turbulence and need to descend to which they cleared us to FL370. We were unable to adequately see the altitude and told them we would be descending until we could get good control of the aircraft. ATC turned a couple of planes out of our way, and we recovered and smoothed out at FL350. After a bit and a visual check of the wings and control checks, we decided it was best to make a precautionary landing to get a better exterior inspection and contact our mechanic. Enroute weather also made us decide to get a better idea if any damage occurred before entering more possible turbulence. Upon landing, we contacted our mechanic, looked at the areas that he recommended for damage, and found none. We also looked at the chart he emailed to us from the maintenance book about weight to G force ratio, and we decided we were in the clear, and no further inspections were needed. The flight continued with no further issues.","","1000, 35000, 37000","1000","35000",FALSE
"54","Departing runway 29 to the west from MMMY, an [air carrier] plane had just landed runway 11 coming from the west. No convective weather was listed in the Dispatch Release with the exception of CB and ice to the distant east/southeast, which we also later confirmed with MMMY Tower. Neither the [landing] plane nor ATC made any mention of weather. We had radar turned on prior to takeoff and concluded that the echoes were associated with the terrain to the west. At about 5,000 feet we entered IMC followed by continuous hail. Just before exiting the IMC conditions we received the following EICAS messages: AP FAIL, AT FAIL, ELEVATOR FAULT, RUDDER FAULT, YD FAULT. I took control of the radios and flight controls, and directed the First officer (FO) to begin running QRH procedures beginning with AP FAIL. I leveled the airplane at 12,000 feet and 250kts initially, and then climbed to FL200 as we were approaching higher terrain. Upon completion of all the QRH procedures and Mechanical Irregularity Chart In Flight, we were left with the EICAS displaying AT FAIL, STALL PROT FAIL, AOA LIMIT FAIL, WINDSHEAR FAIL. We concluded the flight could be completed safely. The FO took control of radio #1 and flight controls. I tried several frequencies attempting to contact [company] Radio and commercial radio, but was unable to establish contact. Via ACARS text message I notified Dispatch/Maintenance of what happened. They agreed the flight could be completed safely, but to contact them on the ground for logbook entries. I resumed control of the flight controls, and we resumed normal speed and climbed to FL300.

At that time we encountered SEVERE turbulence with roll rates in excess of 35 degrees and airspeed changes in excess of 30 knots the aircraft for a short time was uncontrollable. During this encounter while trying to regain control of the aircraft we had a bird strike to complicate matters. I immediately executed a climb and advised the First Officer to let ATC know we were climbing and asked for heading. We climbed to 4,000 feet on a heading and once clear of the worst of the turbulence (Below 3,000 feet) began to assess the situation. Another regional jet was also in the area and was behind us on the approach at a lower altitude. We waited to see the outcome of his approach. He advised the worst was between 3,000 and 1,600 with moderate below 1,000 feet. I elected to attempt a 2nd approach with the intention of diverting if it was unsuccessful. On the second approach the turbulence was only moderate with nowhere near what we encountered the first time.

As we initiated the descent, the turbulence increased and caused us to uncontrollably climb at a rate of up to 2500 feet per minute for 20 to 30 seconds. I immediately instructed my first officer to advise ATC we were in an uncontrolled climb. It was not until 41,200 feet we were able to arrest the climb and reinitiate the descent.  As we passed back through FL400 again the turbulence started to decrease our descent rate but was not strong enough to cause us to climb again. We leveled at FL380 and had a smooth ride and continued the flight as normal.","The jolts we felt would be described as only moderate turbulence, however due to the uncontrolled climb I advised center of severe turbulence.

"72","Flying to ORD we were full of passengers and were fairly heavy. I did check the radar several times before departure and it was one of those days with thunderstorms building everywhere. Around Texas they were fairly scattered at the time and I was more worried about a huge line of storms between Missouri and Chicago. We were on route and had the radar on watching these scattered storms around Laredo, Texas. We did a slow climb the last 1,000 feet to level off at FL390 which was roughly about 1,000 feet above the clouds. After about 2 minutes of level off and at .74 we were approximately 20 miles between each cell with absolutely nothing on the radar in between and in the clear. Then without warning we hit severe turbulence. The First Officer was the one flying at the time and the autopilot kicked off. For a few seconds I let him fly but since he is fairly new I decided to take the controls. The plane was drastically changing altitude of +[/]-1,000-2,000 feet and airspeed changes of +-50 knots approximately. At this point I told the First Officer (FO) to tell ATC we are going down to FL350 and I just tried to keep the attitude indicator somewhat centered as the whole plane was all over. Within this time of about 1-2 minutes (approximately) we did momentarily get the stick shaker I think twice but each time the airspeed would drastically shoot back up but I still did decide to go max power. Even with the descent to FL350 the turbulence did not get better for a while. As soon as we were out of the severe I had the FO call the FA's and ask how they were and to remain seated for now. At the time they were up and they sat on passengers laps and they all worked to hold the cart and everything down. Luckily no one was injured. I then also talked to both dispatch and maintenance to give them a heads up. I feel like I'm a conservative pilot around thunderstorms and especially as a newer captain. In my almost 10 years with the airlines I have experienced a lot and with the information through our radar I honestly feel like we were far enough from these cells and I have never experienced turbulence even close to this and hopefully never again. After this event I kept replaying everything in my head and thinking about what I could have done differently or better. With the information that we had I feel there's nothing I could have done differently unless it was to return to Mexico. From our radar we chose the most conservative path through these scattered thunderstorms. There were no reports from ATC since this is not a busy airspace on the Mexico border and these storms were building fast. I do wish that if dispatch had tools to give us a huge diversion around these cells that could have been a better outcome. Also, with fast changing technology this event may have been avoided if through a tablet and onboard Wi-Fi we could have looked at ground based radar to get the 'bigger picture' of what was happening.","","1000, 2000, 35000, 39000","1000","39000",FALSE
"76","We departed several hours late due to our previous flights' late inbound arrival. Upon initial climb out we enter IMC associated with multiple embedded thunderstorms and local convective activity. While climbing to cruise we encounter chop and light turbulence along with heavy precipitation. Multiple lightning strikes occur in close proximity along with some evidence of heavy static discharge. While climbing through precipitation and receiving vectors to avoid weather, we experience difficult communication issues with various departure and ARTCC controllers. Several aircraft as well as controller communication and transmitter changes were required to maintain contact with ATC. Due to heavy line and storm locations we elected to try to stay on a westerly course until an open area presented itself and we could traverse southerly and continue enroute to ZZZZ. While finding a vacant area of convective radar returns we elected to climb from FL320 to FL360 and proceed on a more southbound route. Shortly after leveling off and additional vectors, an IAS flag on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) indicating a difference in air data was presented. After short discussion about the indication, including the Captain's (pilot flying) recent simulation training, we find ourselves heading through a section of weather that appears to be closing in on us and our planned route through. While this is simultaneously happening both First Officer and Captain side airspeed indications begin to deteriorate. The rate and somewhat erratic change causes us to refer immediately to the erroneous airspeed tables listed in the QRH. These prompted the Captain to take the autopilot off along with disabling the flight director and yaw damper and hand fly the appropriate attitude and power settings being called out by myself (pilot monitoring), as prescribed in the QRH. During the next moments the air data (both my First Officer side and the Captain side) was showing all red Xs. Now with our planned route being closed off, turbulence increasing and workload increasing, the immediate action to return was initially made. ATC was advised along with notification of air data indications and problems. As we begin our turn back, we receive word from ATC that the route back is deteriorating as well. The Captain maintained aircraft control and I began work on notification of dispatch, alternate destination weather, and more QRH reference to aircraft control. The decision to divert to SAT was made. The location and weather was most favorable to us. We also knew we had several other options regarding customs and operations capabilities at SAT versus trying to get to a weather entrenched alternate. As we began a turn and descend we encountered more moderate turbulence, aircraft icing, as well as a loud pop and ozone/burning smell, most likely indicating a lightning strike. Throughout the descent the Captain side at times began to regain some data and then fail again, while my side was relatively void of information regarding air data. We coordinated with ATC to help call out our ground speed and their altitude in order to cross reference ours that was intermittent and maintain positive control. As we prepared for an approach to Runway 4 at SAT, we broke out and into intermittent IMC at about 6,000 feet. During some vectors around more weather into SAT the Captain side began to slowly regain air data. My side was a little more delayed and eventually returned closer to landing. Once on final the pilot flying was able to get a visual on Runway 4 and an overweight landing was made. We taxied under our own power to the terminal where flight termination was made.Threats included in this event are numerous and at times quite compounding. Adverse weather, ATC communication during weather, aircraft malfunction, stress of situation, and distractions based on all outside in influences. Errors included procedural errors based around QRH usage. I originally read the pitch and power settings and based it on the incorrect ERJ model. I did remedy this during descent once I found out I was reading the wrong ones a few pages before. Operational decision errors may have been related to proceeding farther into the storm system then we should have. The decision to divert or even avoid the weather at a greater distance may have kept us from going through the weather cell during descent that was quite rough.It seems especially with some of the foreign flying that we do, our weather gathering or even flight planning might be lacking. Of course our major threat related error was related to an aircraft malfunction, but the multitude of factors and chain of events that led to the subsequent diversion and landing may have been less likely had weather planning been improved or possibly even avoided if the flight was routed better.","","6000, 32000, 36000","6000","36000",FALSE
"77","Weather (low clouds) had made the originally planned trip to my home airport via the most direct airway not possible. A coastal route was chosen due to better weather. This route was planned and the weather was discussed with weather brief services.The new planned route was direct with deviations as clouds and terrain allowed for a shorter trip. Departure [occurred] without issue, and into a normal climb to 7,500 feet MSL due West towards the coastline to avoid mountainous terrain to the North. Plan to turn as soon as terrain and clouds allowed. Remained CTAF until greater than 5NM from the airport, then switched to [local] Approach. Monitored but did not plan to contact [approach] until within 20NM, to allow proper communication with facility and to ensure we were near their airspace. Without certainty but believed to be in the vicinity near the edge of the Class E airspace, climbing through approximately 4,500 feet MSL: as we were climbing Westbound, a single engine, low-wing aircraft heading approximately South-Eastbound crossed above and convergent with our flight-path. Closest distance is believed to be approximately 300 feet. Our landing light was on as well as our strobe light, the other aircraft did not appear to have any lights visible. We were monitoring but not in communication Approach. Factors that contributed were the nature of this airspace being very congested and busy, but we were aware so were heads up and looking for traffic (pilot and passenger). The nature of this airspace has aircraft ascending and descending concurrently, increasing the chances for converging aircraft. Passenger was first to notice the traffic so having two people looking probably helped the situation. Upon identification of the traffic, the passenger notified the pilot immediately and it was determined that no action was required to avoid collision. Not being in communication with the relevant ATC may have contributed as they may have notified both airplanes of our mutual proximity and closing paths. Landing and/or strobe lights may have also helped in seeing the traffic sooner. The other aircraft appeared to be in a slow descent, so may not have had adequate forward visibility to see our aircraft. Following the airway would have had us on a similar flight path so may not have helped, if we'd been using that airway. Using a VFR Flight Plan may have helped in notifying the local ATC facilities of our intention to use the airspace, but that information may have been too course to allow for the fine separation needed in this situation. Though the weather reporting stations South [departure airport] do not indicate clouds, clouds (approximately FEW coverage) were located above the mountainous terrain to the North. This is the direction from which the traffic was flying.","","300, 4500, 7500","300","4500",FALSE
"80","First Officer is flying. FMS airplane at FL330, IMC, deviating around storms. Very little showing up on radar but moderate turbulence and precipitation on front windows. Engine and airfoil anti-ice has been on for quite awhile. A lot of static on radios making it extremely difficult to hear/talk to ATC and distracting to cockpit communications also. On FMS I see CADC1 (central air data computer) data fail and 2 data fail at same time as autopilot and autothrottle disconnects. This is not CADC failure but CADC data fail. No master warning or caution and no off flags anywhere. While I'm flying the Captain says we also have Mach trim compensator inoperative and engine anti-ice valve light on. Captain starts looking through QRH etc.. To figure out what is going on while I continued deviating, flying and dealing with turbulence.  Soon I notice the airplane doesn't feel right followed by inability to hold altitude. I tell Captain to tell Center we're coming down to FL310 while I increase power to climb power and fly the plane down. At the same time I look at Captain's airspeed and it's at 220 kts and increasing. First Officer instruments are still showing 260 kts and .74 Mach. I level off at FL310 and 275 kts and accomplish memory items for unreliable airspeed. There was power showing on all selections of meter selector. Engine and airfoil anti-ice still on also. Very shortly after that we exited precipitation. All indications returned to normal. First Officer instruments all started working normally. Autopilot and autothrottle engaged normally. We were on arrival at that point and continued uneventfully to our filed destination. The altitude deviation was about 400 feet before the Captain was able to get ahold of ATC and tell them we were descending. ATC was fine with that and cleared us to FL310. They didn't question the deviation at all. No emergency was declared but we would have with our next transmission if ATC didn't want us to descend.I don't know what Maintenance was able to find wrong with the plane, if anything. We suspect an icing event of some sort.  Things I could have done better. When transitioning to hand flying cross check power settings more often. Throttle position felt normal and performance indications looked normal on my side. I suspect that when the autothrottle disconnected the power was slightly low due to turbulence deviations and since the performance looked ok on my side I didn't notice it was low. When in icing it would be a good idea to cross check standby and Captain's instruments as well. Pilot not flying can't stop monitoring aircraft performance when troubleshooting either. As usual in an incident/accident chain there are a lot of things that lead up to it. This included deviations due to storms, moderate turbulence, IMC, very abnormal aircraft malfunctions affecting the pilot flying instruments only and static on radios hindering communication and adding another distraction.","There were never any fail flags in the flight instruments.

We were level at FL180 deviating around storm cells in IMC. We encountered moderate to severe turbulence for about 15 seconds and lost all navigation and radios. Our only communication with Center was the transponder that was still working. Unable to get the navigation or radios back in operation we squawked 7600. We broke out into clear weather and decided to descend in VMC down to 3000 feet and look for a suitable airport. We landed at [an airport] and called Center by phone.After shutting down the engines and then turning the Battery Switch back on to trouble shoot this problem all navigation and radios came back on and operated normal.We did a preflight and departed VFR, called Center for VFR flight following to San Marcos (HYI).","On IFR flight plan to HYI (San Marcos, TX) first officer flying, we passed between two buildups. There was a smaller one between the buildups. I thought we would pass over it but we just clipped the top and hit two severe bumps about four seconds apart. Only two and then smooth ride. We then noticed both Garmins (530 & 430) were totally blank. Now we had no navigation and no communication. We recycled avionics and inverters to no avail. We discussed problem and squawked 7600 (lost communications). We were on border between FTW and HOU Center. Don't recall which we were talking to at the time of lost navigation/communication event. I realized we could not navigate accurately and decided we should get on ground before became a hazard to other traffic. I commanded the copilot who was flying to descend to 3,500 MSL so we could find a landing place as soon as possible. We were VMC after the turbulence. After about 10 or 15 minutes we spotted a paved, single runway airport and landed there.After parking and shutdown a man from the small FBO approached us with a phone [number] and name to call. I called, and I explained the situation and he seemed satisfied. Short conversation. We got back in, started up, powered up avionics and all started and worked well. We flew VFR with flight following to HYI. No problems.Next day I mentioned the situation to an avionics shop and learned there is a 5G switch in the Garmins. That was what shut us down. He said we could have totally powered down (batt and gens) and recycled to get Garmins working again. We could have done that in air. Learned something.

"84","At the conclusion of my IFR flight and while cruising at 6000 feet I diverted to my planned alternate, MKL, due to rain at my primary. I was given a descent to 2500 feet and was approximately 15-20 minutes out. This put me in IMC so I lost the ability to see weather in front of me. ASOS at MKL reported a ceiling of 1900 overcast and I think wind of 3 knots at 190. I discussed this with Memphis Center and decided on the visual approach to Runway 20 at MKL. I rechecked the weather some minutes later and the new ASOS had a ceiling of 900 feet with light rain and calm wind. I called Memphis, and asked for the GPS 20 approach with GARTZ as an IAF. They responded with a climb to 3000, direct GARTZ, and cleared for the approach. About 2 min from GARTZ, Memphis called to tell me about moderate to severe rain ahead and I placed it at 2 miles past GARTZ. And then it began to rain with mild turbulence. At GARTZ, as I turned outbound the rain and turbulence became moderate to heavy. Continuing to track around to inbound the rain became very heavy and turbulence, with gusts and swirling, increased severely. As I was finishing the turn I hit an area of very heavy rain and severe turbulence with a very strong downdraft which led to a severe bank angle, nose down attitude and significant loss of altitude. I reduced power and leveled the wings, then increased to full power and full up but was continuing to descend. After coming out the bottom of the clouds the turbulence significantly decreased. The lowest altitude I saw was 1200 feet. Memphis had called several times and each time I answered back with no response. Troubleshooting, now that the airplane was stable, revealed my knee had pulled out the mic plug. After pushing it back in, I called Memphis to report our situation and they asked if I wanted to continue the approach. Because I was able to see in front of me now that I was below the clouds and saw no significant rain I answered affirmative. I climbed back to the appropriate altitude which I attained just prior to ZEALS and then followed the approach breaking out of the clouds at about 800 feet lined up with the runway. In summary, during a GPS approach I encountered severe turbulence, rain and downdrafts that were unknown to me. This resulted in an unusual attitude and loss of altitude resulting in busting altitude restrictions before I, thankfully, recovered. Additionally, an unplugged mic cord prevented me from contacting Memphis to answer their calls.In reviewing the radar plots, I would have never purposely flown into these conditions, especially at such a vulnerable time as during an approach. I have already scheduled time with my instrument instructor to discuss where I could/should have made different decisions and for further practice in unusual attitude recovery.","","800, 900, 1200, 2500, 3000, 6000","900","3000",FALSE
"86","Weather received with flight release prior to departing for TPA visibility was greater than 6 miles, wind variable at 3 KTS, clear forecast for time of arrival. Release included no alternate airport. Considering the weather report available at that time, an alternate airport was not required. Enroute TPA, ZJX Center advised of thunderstorms developing in the TPA area. Captain (pilot monitoring) left Comm 1 to the flying pilot and called Dispatch to obtain an amendment to the flight release indicating MCO as the alternate airport for the flight. Upon arrival in KTPA area, Approach controllers requested keep 'speed up' and expressed confidence that the 'Popup thunderstorm' would quickly dissipate and/or depart the vicinity of TPA. Just prior to switching to Tower frequency, the initial Approach Controller advised that a MD 88 had just landed TPA reporting minimum visibility due to rain but a smooth ride. Thereafter, TPA Final Approach Controller issued instructions to increase speed for in-trail traffic and cleared Aircraft X for ILS 1L approach, 'Maintain 170 KTS until five-mile final.' We Intercepted glide-slope at 2600 feet with autopilot engaged in approach mode. In order to comply with ATC instructions, initial descent on the GS was conducted with the aircraft in 'Clean' configuration at 170 KTS. When we switched to Tower frequency, the Tower Controller alarmed, 'Windshear Alert! 20 knot change in wind speed on the runway and a wind direction change from 320 to 270.' Pilot monitoring verbalized, 'That's on the runway. We'll be down by then (sic). We can continue.' At approximately 1700 feet, pilot flying requested configuration for landing and Landing Checklist slowing the aircraft to approximately 140 KIAS. As Pilot monitoring flipped switches, made PA, and read the landing checklist, aircraft encountered wall of water associated with thunderstorm over TPA. Pilot flying noted and verbalized increase in airspeed in excess of 20 KTS stating, 'That was more than a 20 knot increase in airspeed! We need to break-off this approach!' Pilot monitoring appeared to note airspeed indications, that the autopilot was engaged, and that the current airspeed corresponded to autopilot maintaining GS despite significant updrafts. At about the same time, Tower Controller transmitted, 'The aircraft ahead reported airspeed deviations of 20 KTS on final and just broke off its approach.' Before we could respond, to the Tower an aircraft on approach behind us interrupted to check-on the frequency and advise the Tower Controller that it had just experienced a 20 knot increase in airspeed and intended to break off its approach. Just then, we encountered another 15 knot [plus] increase in airspeed. At that point, we declared our intention to break off the approach requesting immediate turn to avoid further penetration into the thunderstorm. Tower responded with instructions for left turn to heading of 330 and a climb to 3000 feet. Pressing TOGA on the power levers positioned the flight director nose-up. The pilot flying pushed the power levers forward, asked for max power, initiated climb, asked for flaps 7, noted increase in airspeed indication and climb indication on the VSI, turned toward the desired heading (heading bug had been set by the pilot monitoring) and requested gear up prior to 150 KIAS. When pilot flying verbalized that the FD indicated a turn indication opposite the desired direction, the pilot monitoring pressed the FD mode sector on the autopilot control panel stowing the distraction. We found clear air about five miles from the airport. The crew discussed fuel quantity, considered the fuel consumption effect of another approach attempt... followed by another missed and then a flight to the alternate in trail of several other aircraft that were also likely to also be deviating at that time. Upon receiving additional information from the TPA Approach Controller that the once dissipating thunderstorm now appeared to be building in intensity once again and 'Boiling' over TPA, Aircraft X departed immediately for its alternate, MCO. At least two air carriers and a couple other aircraft diverted to MCO. One B737 aircraft opened that it had plenty of fuel and elected to hold for several minutes. A corporate jet aircraft requested to hold over 'Airshow' to keep an eye on the thunderstorm with expressed intent to advise ATC when ready for approach. The request was denied. The explanation given was that too many aircraft were being diverted through that airspace. Consequently, the jet expressed its intention to divert to LAL. Aircraft X diverted to and landed at MCO without further adventure. Following a personal after-action analysis, and a review of Aircraft X subject matter pertaining to the events, the pilot flying has concluded that a unique cascade of errors lead Aircraft X to commence an approach into severe windshear in violation of company policy. The errors included: -Absence of reliable forecast weather data available to the dispatchers and to the flight crew before the flight departed. -Failure of the flight dispatch process to assure timely monitoring of changing airport conditions throughout the conduct of the flight from departure and prior to the arrival of Aircraft X at TPA.-The initial, intermediate and final approach controller's assurances that the thunderstorm appeared to be local in nature, temporary, dissipating, and moving away from TPA, issuing instructions to 'Keep your speed up,' combined with rapidly changing weather conditions, and miscommunication between the TPA Tower Controller and TPA Approach controllers that were handling the flight. A Flight Dispatcher must monitor the progress of each flight under that Dispatcher's control until the flight has landed or until the Dispatcher is relieved by another Flight Dispatcher and must keep the PIC or any other party involved in operational control notified of any significant weather change that could present a challenge to safety of flight. Flight monitoring, at a minimum, must consist of the monitoring of each flight's fuel state, flight time remaining, destination and alternate airport weather trends, enroute winds and weather (including Pilot or other reports reflecting clear air turbulence, thunderstorms and low level windshear), and the status of airport and navigational facilities.The power of a thunderstorm is extreme and the potential for placing your aircraft, crew and passengers into a hazardous situation is very real. Turbulence, windshear, heavy rain, lightning, ice and hail are all associated with thunderstorms. Crews will use all available resources to detect and avoid thunderstorms.Windshear Avoidance1. Carefully assess all available information such as pilot reports of windshear or turbulence, low-level windshear alerts (LLWSA) and weather reports including thunderstorm activity. Avoid areas of known windshear.2. Severe windshear is that which produces un-commanded airspeed changes greater than 15 knots. If severe windshear is indicated, do not takeoff or continue an approach until conditions improve. Report any windshear encounters precisely and promptly. Whenever a pilot reports windshear, controllers are mandated by regulations to advise other pilots.If windshear conditions with airspeed variations of +- 15 knots from the stabilized approach speed are encountered, a go around should be initiated.","","150, 330, 1700, 2600, 3000","150","1700",FALSE
"87","En-route to ZZZ we began approaching a line of thunderstorms that extended from South Florida to Indianapolis. At FL330 our flight plan had us on the West side of these storms, and knew we eventually had to cross the frontal zone at some point in order to get on east side of the storms. With INDY Center we repeatedly asked for a left deviation to get around the North side of the building storms, and were simply ignored after several attempts. (No call back from INDY Center, nothing, other aircraft equally ignored, except for one, who ignored their INDY ATC, and told the controller, 'I am not letting you fly me through a thunderstorm'). Now we were stuck on the West side of the front and had to deviate even further to the West, with a plan to loop around the weather in South Florida, which was also building. Glad I had dispatch add another 1,000lbs fuel. Eventually had to climb to FL390 to stay above the tops/blow off, with still a 1,200 feet margin to max, altitude, and save fuel. With ATL Center, controller advised that a gap existed in the vicinity of LGC, through which several aircraft were making it through. After a good look on the radar, we proceeded through the recommended gap, SAT -54C. As we crossed the frontal zone, I noticed the airspeed rolling back, and trend vector continuing to show slower passed the clean min maneuvering speed, engines at max climb thrust. Simultaneously we began picking up ice, at least 1/4 inch on the window. I told my First Officer to request FL380 or lower immediately, as the airplane would slow to the point of not being able to maintain FL390. First Officer could not get a word in edge wise as another aircraft (previously denied by ATL ATC) was declaring to ATC they were leaving FL430 for FL410 and could not maintain altitude. SAT was now -27C and the aircraft still slowing now into the clean min man maneuver speed 'J hook'.  Exercised Captain's emergency authority. Switched off the auto pilot and began a descent. Passing FL388 First Officer was able to obtain clearance to FL380. Speed immediately began to build back up to normal, and we continued at FL380. Lowest speed I saw was 219 KTS IAS, and we did not get the 'low speed' aural warning, as the situation was corrected by then. Flight continued normally at FL380 until clear of traffic, and then descended to FL370, appropriate for direction of flight. 1. The abstinence of this controller denying several aircraft of their requests to deviate around the weather set up this whole scenario. (Presumably this controller did not want to be bothered with the pending workload of several reroutes, and the longer he delayed, the further South we would be, and eventually cross into someone else's airspace. No longer his problem!2. In future I will begin with a 'Pan, Pan, Pan' call, if unanswered 'Mayday, Mayday, Mayday'. INDY Center needs to get their act together! 3. Would have descended sooner without ATC clearance to avoid getting 15 KTS slow, at altitude.","","1200, 33000, 37000, 38000, 38800, 39000, 41000, 43000","38000","39000",FALSE
"91","We were on the GIBBZ2 arrival into IAD, between SIYOB [and] MIKEJ intersections. My hands were on the controls and aircraft was steady at 210 knots assigned and 4000 feet. The auto-pilot was on. We were already briefed and ready for the ILS 01C. All check lists were completed and we were waiting for a vector to final to intercept the ILS. This entire event was over maybe an 8-10 second period. We encountered wingtip vortices from a B737 that was 6 miles in front of us. I had my hands on the controls at the time it started. When all of a sudden the right wing was automatically forced down. I turned the yoke to the left and seemed to regain control of the aircraft. When we were back to level, the wing took another dip. At this point, I thought the autopilot was malfunctioning and quickly hit the trim switch to disengage it quickly. Then when the wing dipped again and with more force and a little further down. This time I had almost full left aileron in to keep the aircraft up right. We were never over 45 degrees at any point. I estimate it to be in the 30-35 degrees. But when it is uncommanded, it was startling, and I was having trouble maintaining 100% control of the aircraft. Then once I would gain control again, it would start again. So, it was an intermittent event, as it would start and stop. By the 3rd time the aircraft was bumped around. We had figured we were hitting a vortex off another aircraft. First officer (F/O) ask if we were following anybody. ATC replied with a B737, 6 miles in front of us. I told him to request an immediate climb, as vortices go down and out. F/O was on the ball and requested it, the controller responded with a climb to 6000 feet. I started an immediate climb and we seemed to be clear of it, after we had climbed maybe 75 feet. Then the controller revised the clearance to maintain 5000 feet. We leveled at 5000 feet and he then turned us east bound on a left base leg. The F/O had 2 or 3 direct transmissions with ATC with no delays or other aircraft talking. He reported the turbulence, asked about traffic, requested a climb, all in a few seconds and it seemed to work out very well. This was maybe a 10 second time period. But, it was very quick, very abrupt, then we were out of it and turning left to intercept and starting a descent back down to 3000 for the approach. I ask him to check on the passengers. They said they were ok, and we would explain once on the ground. Once on the ground, engines shut down. I jumped up to greet them and explain with a big apology for the turbulence. The passenger explained his wife was in the lav and that was a great thing as she was fearful of flying. I explained to them the vortices of airplanes. They were thankful for of our work in the process. At one point, he thought we might actually end up rolling it completely over. I assured him we were not even at the 45 degree mark, but I understand his position being in the back and having a view that would maybe make him think that. They seemed happy and satisfied with the flight and went on their [way]. I briefed [Company] of the incident as well and they noted it on their files too.","","4000, 5000, 6000","5000","4000",FALSE
"96","While on the Dirty Arrival descending through 13,000 FT, we experienced severe wake turbulence 6 miles in trail and 1000 feet above a B747. We notified ATC and requested to level at 12,500 feet and slow from 280 knots to 250 knots. We did that, continued arrival and landed without event.We experienced an undesired aircraft state. I believe the B747 was very heavy and the afternoon heat, lifting action and convective activity contributed to the wake turbulence.","","1000, 12500, 13000","1000","13000",FALSE
"98","[Aircraft Y] was under my control landing LGA at 4,000 feet MSL on a vector across the localizer for runway 22 for spacing on final. HPN was departing runway 16 on the SID climbing to 3,000 feet MSL. [Aircraft X] departed HPN in the climb and did not turn per the SID but instead remained runway heading. I did notice the blown SID off of HPN and began to issue [Aircraft Y] a traffic call to point out [Aircraft X] climbing to 3,000 feet. Mid-transmission, I stopped my traffic call since I realized [Aircraft X] was now at 3,500 feet on the next radar sweep. As I began to issue the traffic alert to [Aircraft Y], he keyed up right before I did and responded to the RA he received on Aircraft X still in the climb (now at 3,800 feet) and began his evasive maneuver to turn/climb away from the aircraft in conflict. Targets were approximately 1.2 NM and 300 feet separated at the closest instance. No recommendations can be given since the pilot that departed HPN deviated from the HPN runway 16 SID's turn/altitude published. The climb through 3,000 feet from the J328 was a fast climb rate. Thus, the RA that [Aircraft Y] responded to was obviously the right move steering the aircraft away from [Aircraft Y].","We were just about to load passengers when my first officer called me to tell me we had a DC tie failure. This led to an flight director to shutdown, an hx fan failure which caused the left pack to overheat and fail. After running the checklist it was determined that we would wait until we got into the air to reset the left pack to let it cool down and try to reset the pack in flight.On the taxi checks the pilot flying and the non flying pilot reset the flight director for takeoff configuration. We selected the left pack and left bleed while on taxi and it still showed as failed so we deselected the bleed and pack for the left side and decided to wait until airborn to try to reset again.With left pack failed the n1% were split by 10-15% being high on left side so pilot flying tried to keep n1 balanced during takeoff roll. At 400 feet the flaps up yaw damp on call was made as normal. On Climb out I continued to monitor the n1 guages to maintain balance. The flight director was selected for nav mode and I continued to follow the command bar directions which did not command the right turn from the SID.  At acceleration height I called for climb check and at the same time ATC called to see if we started our turn. We advised we were starting turn and turned at less than standard bank for passenger comfort. While in the turn and climbing at 3,500 feet per minute ATC then advised a turn to heading 350 in which I selected the autopilot on in heading mode. Close to roll out on the 350 degree heading the non flying pilot noticed traffic on the right both high and low. Traffic low was a blimp off the departure end of the runway and to the west, traffic high was jet traffic on a converging course. We also noted at this time that the autopilot had not captured the 3,000 feet as selected in the altitude select. I then clicked off the auto pilot and agressivly nosed the airplane down for a descent to maintain seperation from the higher jet traffic. Once leveled off at 3,000 feet we continued to recieve radar vectors for another 10 min until being told to go direct to JFK VOR. Enroute to JFK we reselected the autopilot on and continued to closely monitor all climbs and level offs until cruise altitude. At this point I called for the QRH cheklist for pack failure. The non flying pilot was to run the checklist while I Flew the plane and ran the radios. We got the left pack back online and continued for a few more minutes. Shortly after crossing the JFK VOR the flight director went off line in flight. I elected at this to hand fly the aircraft until we reached Atlantic City airport as I suspected there was an issue with the flight guidance system. Upon dropping off our passangers I then called maintenance about the pack failures and DC tie failure. We discussed possible reasons for DC tie failures. We conducted a quick evaluation consisting of turning off a DC hydraulic pump and turning it back on. We discovered there was a spike in the system which was determined why the pack and flight director had failed. Maintenance suggested if it happened again, were we lost the flight director on the ground,to shut the airplane down to reset the systems of the autopilot. I also called our company saftey manager to discuss the chain events that led to the RA. I also called the director of operations and discussed these items with him as well. Upon contiuing our day the autopilot system seemed to work normally but we had one more occurance of DC tie failure before the end of our duty day. The cause the the problems were multiple system malfunctions before takeoff that led to erroneous readings in a high traffic voulme environment causing crew to have to take evasive actions to avoid conflict. We fly SIDs and STARS on a daily basis and rely on the auto guidance system to give us correct information. To prevent this from happening in the future the non flying pilot and I have discussed how we could change the after takeoff scanof the instrumentaion and the priority of what should be handled first in a situation like this.","300, 350, 400, 3000, 3500, 3800, 4000","300","3800",FALSE

We had just passed another [air] carrier aircraft going opposite direction 1,000 FT above us approximately three miles to our east. (Possible wake turbulence).

"105","As we were beginning the approach for Runway 9R into PHL, just outside the final approach fix (KELEE) we encountered severe turbulence causing a momentary loss of aircraft control. We initially lost about 400 feet of altitude then an immediate reversal of the descent to about 2000 FT per minute climb to about 3,500 FT MSL before regaining control over the altitude. We also received roll deviations which were corrected. Upon the initial encounter of the turbulence, I called for a go-around and proceeded to advise ATC of the severe turbulence and advised we were not able to maintain our assigned altitude of 3,000 ft. The First Officer maintained wings and pitch level as best he could and added power as I brought the condition levers up. We received a vector to exit the approach corridor and proceeded south where we continued to receive moderate turbulence. We reconfigured the aircraft for normal flight and advised ATC we would need to divert.  Heavy rain showers in the area created moderate turbulence all around PHL. ATC advised the approach corridor looked acceptable on the radar so we accepted the approach clearance. We also did not detect any signs that severe turbulence may occur on the aircraft radar. We proceeded with a go-around and exited the area of severe turbulence and diverted. A maintenance write up was made because of the severe turbulence encounter. I believe there is a stigma about calling turbulence severe. If the aircraft in front of us had advised ATC that the turbulence was in fact severe, we would have never proceeded with the approach. After landing, the pilots of that aircraft in front of us had also diverted and admitted they should have reported the encounter as severe. Pilots should be reminded that it not only affects them when they label turbulence severe, but also keeps other aircraft from going through that same area.","","400, 2000, 3000, 3500","400","3000",FALSE

I lost 1000 feet of altitude within a few seconds and had trouble controlling the airplane.  Philly approach told me I was descending below their radar coverage to which I replied that I was trying to climb back to 2500 and would like to head back to LNS (my listed alternate) to wait out the weather at MQS.I regained altitude, Philly handed me off to Lancaster tower and I landed there uneventfully. I am sure I deviated from the assigned altitude due to downdrafts and windshear.  Even though Chester County Airport looked clear on both radar sources, in fact the weather was worse than depicted.  Lesson learned:  I should have just requested a deviation to the alternate before getting close to potential weather issues.","","1000, 2500","1000","2500",FALSE

It felt like hitting pot holes in a fast car with no shocks. Worst episode I have encountered in 34 years of flying. The autopilot roll mode disengaged due to the severity of the event. Aircraft control was impossible for those 5 seconds. I lowered my head to avoid possible impact with ceiling and watched the instruments. Aircraft descended and banked left 20-25 degrees.

We asked for medical services to meet us at the gate. We got direct clearance to short final and I kept the speed up. I flew 270 KTS for a bit below 10,000 ft.

"144","While approaching the SAT VOR, Houston Center began giving us vectors for spacing into Houston and assigned us to maintain Mach .75. We were passing north of a line of weather extending from COT to past Houston. After passing SAT, were given a turn back towards the south and handed over to the previous center controller. The line of weather was approximately 40 miles to the south of our position. The pilot flying (PF) and I agreed we would quickly need a turn. The controller cleared us to deviate right of course and proceed direct CRP when able. I expected to be turned back towards Houston. Rather, were being given a clearance through the weather. I asked the controller for a route to Houston that didn't involve flying through the worst part of the line. He responded that we could proceed direct COT direct CRP. The PF and I agreed that at least that would keep us out of the weather and give us time to coordinate with dispatch. Also, that route would provide us with many airports to divert to if necessary. We discussed the different options we had as I sent an update through ACARS to dispatch.Approaching COT, there were a few small cells painting on the radar at our 10 o'clock at 25 miles. Since we had been cleared to COT and to deviate as necessary, I assumed the PF was planning on going around the western edge of the weather and then we would continue on our assigned route to CRP. While it was partially imbedded, I could see the base of a smaller towering cumulus (TCU) in front of us over COT. I was also painting it on weather radar. We were in the clear and the ride was smooth. I told the PF that we needed to come farther to the right to avoid the weather in front of us. He disagreed with me and said he was beginning the turn towards the southeast. There was a clear opening in the line but there was quite a bit of blowoff which I think prevented the PF from seeing the TCU in front of us. I did not realize this at the time, but I think the PF's radar may have been angled up too high and he was only seeing the taller cells. Instead of turning right and staying in the clear as I expected, we turned left. I think he thought the weather that I was painting was farther away from us than it really was (the radar range on my display was set to 25 miles while his was at 50.) I called the flight attendant to make sure that he and the passengers were seated.The PF had the airplane slowing as we encountered severe turbulence for approximately 10 seconds. I believe that we flew through the edge of the very top of a cell which was obscured. The airplane gained about 3 hundred feet of altitude and rolled approximately 20 degrees. The autopilot disconnected and the PF had hold of the controls. We were able to quickly return the FL370.We quickly exited the weather as the part we had passed through was only about 10 miles wide (the far western edge of it.) We checked with the flight attendant to make sure that no one had been injured. He said everyone was fine. I reported the severe turbulence to ATC. We also reported our encounter to dispatch.I believe that during the turbulence we encountered super cooled droplets and the airframe picked up ice on unprotected areas of the fuselage. We did have a wing anti-ice failure which we cleared using the QRH procedure. Later on, during the descent and passing through more icing we received an ice detector 2 fail message. We followed the QRH procedure for that as well. The plane was performing as if there was ice buildup on the fuselage and we could see ice on the nose. The wing leading edges appeared free of ice. We were fairly confident that any ice on the plane would melt before the approach due to warm temperatures on the ground in Houston. Additionally, we had gotten the wing anti ice failure message to clear. We ran the QRH for loss of anti-icing in icing conditions. If unsure that ice has been cleared from the wings and tail, it calls for a flaps 22 landing with an increased approach speed. In case the updrafts and a super cooled droplets had put ice on unprotected areas of the wings, flaps, and tail, we decided to follow this part of the procedure.Passing through 15,000 we could see ice coming off the nose and the aircraft seemed to lose some drag and was flying normally. We still elected to land flaps 22 per the QRH procedure. The severe turbulence and anti-icing system failures were written in the aircraft logbook and reported to maintenance control.The aircraft encountered severe turbulence and super cooled droplets which attached to parts of the airframe. Additionally we deviated 300 feet from our assigned altitude. Threats included the weather and changes to ATC routing into Houston. We may have had an error in our use of weather radar. There was an error in judgment in choosing to fly too close to the weather.Requesting plans stated from the PF is crucial for shared mental model. If I had more warning that he intended to turn just before COT, we would have had more time to come up with a better plan together. Plans stated could have avoided that situation in the first place. For example, 'We are going to go all the way around the west side of the cells and if either of us thinks we should do otherwise, we'll both agree to it first.' Time to discuss would have allowed us to trap the error in tilt management of the radar.I wish that I had asserted myself more quickly. It was clearly not our intention to fly too close to the thunderstorms and TCU. We were not experiencing any pressure to hurry to Houston. The PF thought the clouds in this area were merely blow off and didn't expect anything to be embedded in it. He was not expecting us to encounter severe turbulence.","After the turbulence encounter, we then encountered a significant amount of freezing precipitation during the descent into IAH. During this encounter the aircraft performance was reduced as far as our ability to hold airspeed while the thrust levers where in the detent, with cruise power selected. We were able to successfully shed the ice by seeking out warmer air, while keeping our airspeed high, to have the highest Total Air Temperature as possible. While this is happening we received a Wing Anti-ICE failure and an Ice detector 2 failure, and Ice condition anti-ice inoperative EICAS messages. Using the QRH for the anti-ice failure we were unable to clear the message. Due to this we continued with the QRH anti ice condition with the anti ice inoperative all the way to a successful landing.The threats on this flight were the turbulence, followed by the severe icing, all while deviating around significant weather with multiple ATC re-routes. All of this kept us very busy while troubleshooting and running the QRH checklists. To summarize, our workload was extremely high.Regarding the turbulence encounter; I felt we handled the turbulence very well. While I was hand flying the aircraft the FO and I were able to easily communicate with the FA, and he did a great job making sure the passengers were seated while we were deviating around the weather with the multiple ATC re-routes. Our FA also followed our instructions to sit in his jump seat during the turbulence. MY FO also did a great job of communicating with ATC during the event. All of this made it very easy for me to concentrate on keeping the aircraft under control and returning it to the assigned altitude quickly and as smooth as possible.This was the first time I have encountered turbulence of this severity, and I felt it was very similar to what I have seen during our simulator training. I am very thankful to have had those experiences prior to the real life encounter. We need to continue to train this way, and make every effort to keep the experiences fresh. During our encounter with the severe icing we had multiple EICAS messages related to the anti ice failure. It was difficult to manage that with also dealing with the constant ATC re-routing for all the weather in the Houston area that morning. It would seemingly be impossible to prevent that situation again from happening, but I felt all of us as a crew (working as a crew), our capacity to handle this multifaceted situation was appropriate.","300, 15000, 37000","300","37000",FALSE
"145","While in cruise at FL370 with the autopilot engaged in smooth air, we encountered a sudden severe turbulence event probably associated with mountain wave activity. During the event, the airframe speed reached Mach .85 momentarily, followed by airspeed excursions of +/- 20 KIAS, +/- five degrees of bank, and altitude change of +200 feet. The encounter was brief and sudden, with two sudden 'jolts' of turbulence, then mostly light chop during the mountain wave which affected the aircraft a further 2 minutes or so. The autopilot and autothrottles remained engaged throughout the event, although manual power control was necessary to remain at a safe airspeed.Occasional MDT turbulence was forecast along our offshore route and we had made several altitude changes in the previous twenty minutes to find smoother air, helped out by reports from several other flights ahead of us bound for SECL. Occasional MDT turbulence and Occasional MDT mountain wave were also forecast in the immediate area of the encounter, however no other traffic had reported turbulence activity eastbound. Although we had been in smooth air for approximately five minutes prior to the encounter, the seat belt sign was illuminated due to the forecast.Immediately prior to the event we were at 295,000 LBS Gross weight and Mach .815. The captain was in the cabin in the crew rest seat. The event occurred while eastbound near REPEV on UL560, near the crux of the Andes mountain range.After the event, the cabin crew reported that service items had been displace to the floor and one Flight Attendant (FA) had hot coffee spilled on him and possibly burned. No actual injuries were noted, however, and the FA who had the spilled coffee said later he was alright. No passenger issues were reported to us in the cockpit.","[Report narrative contained no additional information].","200, 37000","200","37000",FALSE
"148","I just learned that there was an issue, that some people were injured. Aircraft X was handed-off to ZTL (T08) and switched to their frequency without any reported issue.Several minutes later, T08 called back to relay that Aircraft X had reported severe turbulence on their frequency at the ZME/ZTL boundary (near JANES intersection), with no other information, no injuries reported. (Of course, injuries are not required to make the report serious; any severe turbulence report is dangerous). For the next hour I relayed the PIREP to pilot's heading anywhere near the area regardless of altitude. During the same time frame, I received severe turbulence reports (if I remember the specifics correctly) [near] BHM at FL370 [also at the ZME/ZTL boundary] and over MON at FL340. Aircraft eastbound and westbound near these areas received the PIREPs but reported no ill effects.ZTL did a great job, calling me to ensure I received the PIREP. We all forward PIREPs to our local Center Weather Service Unit (CWSU) for facility dissemination but that does not ensure the information gets passed to adjacent facilities. Controllers should verbally coordinate PIREPs occurring near their facility boundary. I've found this more commonly occurs near Approach Controls, but the need is the same for adjacent ARTCCs. Turbulence is especially difficult because it can develop and then dissipate so quickly, with preceding and following aircraft not finding it.","","34000, 37000","34000","37000",FALSE
"163","At FL270, approximately one hour after takeoff, flying in icing conditions with wing and engine anti-ice systems selected 'ON', the right pneumatic duct overheated and the right pressure regulating shutoff valve closed. Followed QRH procedures and opened the isolation valve per the checklist. Approximately 30 minutes later, the left pressure regulating shutoff valve automatically closed, leaving the aircraft with no pneumatic air supply. Attempted to restore the left side pneumatic air supply per the QRH but was not successful. Immediately [notified] ATC while simultaneously starting the APU and both pilots donning oxygen masks. Requested to descend out of icing conditions and get the cabin altitude below 10,000 feet. No more icing conditions after descending below FL190. After descending below 17,000 feet, the aircraft started re-pressurizing with the APU pneumatic system. Aircraft was being stored for over one year in the high desert in Southern California. Aircraft parts fail at a higher rate when placed in adverse weather conditions after being stored for such a long period of time.Very difficult to prevent this type of event when the aircraft is stored for such a long period of time.","","10000, 17000, 19000, 27000","10000","27000",FALSE
"166","During to SFO the flight descended below an assigned altitude at a fix. During this flight I was the pilot flying and I was assisted by first officer as pilot monitoring. The conditions of the flight were daylight, clear sky, moderate wind from the west. The SFO airport was landing and departing from 28L and 28R. During the initial descent from FL280 we received ATIS and planned to execute the SERFR1 arrival followed by the Tip Toe Visual 28L. Initially we were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL240. We began the descent and were cleared to descend via the SERFR1 arrival, runway 28 transition. The bottom altitude is 4000 feet at the transition fix of MENLO per the Arrival. However the FMS was loaded to reflect an Altitude of 5000 feet at MENLO per the Tip Toe Visual approach minimum altitude. While descending our instructions were changed to Descend VIA SERFR1 except maintain 10,000. At this point we were told to expect Tip Toe visual 28L. All FMS entries were completed prior to this point and we identified that we would be continuing as briefed. Descending through 11,000 feet we were told to Descend and maintain 8000 feet. Quickly after we were instructed to expedite descent. Green FLCH was selected via the Guidance panel and speed brakes were deployed to increase the rate of descent. ATC instructed to continue descent maintain 6000 Feet, increase rate of descent. We gave the best rate down via Green FLCH and speed brakes. At 7000 feet approximately we were cleared to cross MENLO at 4000 feet (the FMS was loaded at 5000 feet per instructions that we would be cleared TIP TOE VISUAL 28L) and then Cleared for the Tip toe Visual 28L. However it was only seconds later that ATC amended the instruction yet again to add another altitude. They instructed us to cross 9 miles from the runway at 3100 feet. The Altitudes loaded into the FMS were currently, MENLO 5000/230 Knots First bridge 2500 At or above and final bridge 1800 feet. The first officer quickly read back the instruction and began trying to input a distance into the FMS so that we could identify where 9 miles would be. While he was loading the FMS and we were trying to determine the best way to identify this point the aircraft descended below 4000 feet. Because we were expediting the descent the altitude deviation was noticed immediately before 4000 feet but we were unable to arrest the descent rate until 3700 feet. Power was added and the auto pilot removed to climb the aircraft to 4000 feet. ATC was notified immediately that we were returning to our assigned altitude. A TCAS traffic advisory was presented for an aircraft at 2500 feet and 10:00 from our aircraft position. We saw traffic, were instructed to continue and returned to 4000 feet as soon as possible. I believe the aircraft crossed the MENLO intersection at 4000 feet but due to workload and task saturation I can't confirm it. The first officer also quickly finished locating the 9DME point from the runway. We Crossed this point at 3100 feet and continued to descend across the bridges at our assigned altitudes. I understand that this report will be complicated to read due to the incredible amount of altitude assignments and changes that were given. I attribute the situation that we encountered to this directly. The automation was operating correctly and I as pilot flying did fail to select VNAV to support us in our descent across the MENLO interception. However, all of these complicated instructions were given approximately 4 miles from the MENLO fix. At the assigned aircraft speed it was nearly impossible to load the FMS correctly in that short amount of time. In addition first officer did an excellent job monitoring my flying and trying to input information into the FMS, However I needed to look away to confirm his entries. I also needed to pay special attention to the entry as the first officer is still within his first 100 hours in the aircraft. Although he did an excellent job, I needed to back him up with his entry as well. Due to the short period of time, the aircraft speed and the instruction to expedite the descent, I failed to cross the MENLO intersection at the assigned altitude. In a time critical situation our communication was good. We also did our best to back each other up in our decisions. I feel like as a flight crew we did well to work together to recover our altitude and fix the problem that we encountered due to incorrect FGP usage while trying to comply with company policy. Although I feel that we failed to follow company SOP by having two pilots' heads down at the same critical moment, I feel that we are also instructed to confirm FMS entries and confirm navigation plans. I know that having two pilots heads down directly lead to our failure in allowing the aircraft to descend beyond our assigned crossing altitude. However I feel that not verifying the entire into the FMS is just as dangerous. I don't know that we acted incorrectly or actually violated a company SOP, however I know the time we had was not adequate to confirm our entries as well as keep one pilot heads up. I also feel that the charting procedures for SFO airport and particularly the SERFR1 arrival and TIP TOE VISUAL 28L should be reviewed. This is a common clearance and procedure used in SFO. However the altitudes for the procedures conflict between the two charts and the FMS at the MENLO intersection. This is a HIGH WORKLOAD environment that is extremely saturated with aircraft. I also feel that SFO approach exercised extremely poor air traffic management. Completing abnormal FMS entries during a turn to final is a poor time for ATC to assign a non-routine clearance. In addition the constant changing of descent clearances makes arriving into SFO a constant challenge. SFO is nearly impossible to plan for because the clearances are changed constantly, expedite is often used and regularly you're told to expect the charted Visual approach and then cleared for the ILS during a turn to final. This is common practice in SFO. In our particular situation, the weather was beautiful and this increased general aviation traffic. The increase and locations of these VFR targets makes the approach control give the crossing restrictions in a very complicated and time critical location. After this approach to 28L we were then required to side step to another runway 28R. In such a close proximity to all these other things it is very complicated to make complicated FMS entries which are required to navigate to lateral points with vertical restrictions.","Automation setup: auto pilot on, auto throttle on, coupled PIC side. On arrival to SFO, NorCal approach cleared us to descend and maintain FL240. The pilot flying selected FL240 in the preselect window, verified altitude restrictions as pre-loaded in the FMS and commanded a descend now VNAV descent from the autopilot. SOP checklist usage and cabin announcements accomplished at appropriate time. Further clearance to descend via the SERFR1 Arrival into SFO was received. The bottom altitude of 4000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect and verified. Continuing the descent we were re cleared to descend via except maintain 10,000 feet after EPICK. 10,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then clearance was received to expedite descent and maintain 8,000 feet. FLCH green guidance was commanded with usage of speed brakes and 8,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then further clearance was received to descend maintain 6,000 feet. 6,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then further clearance was received to descend via and cleared the tiptoe visual approach to 28L cross MENLO 4,000, cross the SFO 9DME at or above 3,100 feet. 1,800 feet set in the altitude preselect with FLCH green guidance still engaged. Descending through 4,000 feet 4NM prior MENLO the First Officer verbalized the pending deviation and manipulated the flight controls through the use of the TCS button and the yolk to arrest the descent. The PIC responded immediately with a verbal confirmation of the deviation and manipulation of the flight control through use of the auto pilot disconnect button and the yolk. The altitude deviation was 300 feet down to 3700 feet before the descent could be arrested. A Traffic Advisory was sounded where a TCAS target was displayed 10 o'clock relative to aircraft position 2,500 feet below. The First Officer notified ATC of the deviation and notified again when return to 4,000 feet was accomplished. Task saturation, mismanagement of automation and a failure to crosscheck instrumentation left the aircraft in an undesirable state. I do believe a flaw of the compass procedures of setting the absolute bottom of the approach is flawed because it would only keep the aircraft on a proper descent path in magenta FMS vertical guidance. A better method would be to set the hard altitude restrictions in the altitude preselect and readjust the altitude selector once the restrictions are assured to be met.","300, 1800, 2500, 3100, 3700, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 10000, 11000, 24000, 28000","4000","3700",FALSE
"168","We were cruising at FL360, in cirrus type clouds, experiencing continuous light chop.  Seat belt sign was on, and no returns were depicted on the weather radar display.  We had heard no PIREPs or advisories concerning turbulence or convective activity.  Suddenly, the turbulence increased to moderate, and we heard rain hitting the airplane.  This lasted 5-10 sec, then we experienced a rapid, almost instant 1,500 fpm climb to an altitude about 400 feet above the assigned altitude.  Immediately thereafter, we felt a drop as we exited the clouds.  The Captain was Pilot Flying and returned the airplane to the assigned altitude....By the time we coordinated with flight attendants as to passenger and/or crew injuries, made a plan as to how best to address the situation, and checked in with Center, we were very near our top of descent.  We were still getting information as to passenger injuries and we needed to prepare for our approach.  We requested a straight-in, expedited approach.  During the descent, we were still coordinating with the cabin crew, answering questions from Center, and setting up for the approach and landing.   I (pilot not flying) called ahead to Operations to advise them that we were in-range and needed medical personnel to meet the flight. I'm not sure how we could have avoided this event. The Captain did have the seat belt sign on, and made a predeparture PA telling the passengers to leave seat belts fastened while seated.  He also made a PA 'Flight attendants be seated immediately', as the event began, which according to the number 1, allowed him to avoid injury.","","400, 1500, 36000","400","36000",FALSE

"171","While deviating southeastward to avoid a strong line of thunderstorms, deviations continued well past our original estimate of 80 NM. As we continued along the eastern edge of the front about 200 NM looking for a safe opening, we lost situational awareness and exceeded 50 NM offshore without life rafts on board. Around the time we finally realized that we had exceeded this limitation, we received an ATC report of an aircraft in 'moderate' turbulence experiencing a loss of 800 feet in altitude. Because a course reversal would have been well over 200 NM, and deviations westward were ill advised, I elected to exercise Captains Authority and continued along the front a little further until it was safe to turn back shoreward. Even then, we experienced continuous moderate turbulence while crossing over the line. We received a message from our Dispatcher after we became aware, reminding us not to exceed 50 NM. I replied that I was exercising Captains Authority and that it was not safe to turn eastward citing the ATC reported altitude loss event. At the most extreme, we were approximately 120 NM offshore (as we verified by our dispatcher). Given previous personal experience utilizing the old CRJ 900 waiver for 147 NM off shore without a life raft, I knew that if I remained above FL250, I would be within gliding distance of several airports along the coast. I discussed this information with the Pilot Flying and suggested that we climb from FL260 back up to FL300 to increase the safety margin.Once clear of the line, we immediately requested vectors due West (abeam Ormond Beach, OMN) to once again position ourselves no more than 50NM offshore. From that position, we requested to rejoin the new arrival at a fix that would keep us within the limitation. I never told ATC that I was exercising Captains Authority as they were extremely helpful and granted every request made without any priority handling. Had that been necessary, I would not have hesitated. I only informed the First Officer and our Dispatcher.We believed, looking at the radar, that we would be able to turn back towards our filed route with only a minor 80 NM deviation. When we were unable to find a hole along the ATC suggested heading, we should have queried ATC as to where we could expect to be able to turn back Southwesterly. Had we the plotted the closest fix, it would have been immediately evident that we were going to exceed the limitation and would have opened a discussion as to a possible diversion airport. Alternately, informing our dispatcher of our 'minor' deviation in a more timely manner would have alerted him to keep an eye on our position and he might have been able to alert us proactively and helped avoid our transgression. Also, workload permitting, and in no way relieving me of any blame for losing situational awareness, ATC could have volunteered that deviations were currently exceeding 50 NM offshore. Most regional jets do not carry life rafts and I believe that the NYC area controllers have been made aware this after several shortcuts offered along the NY/NJ coast led to similar 50 NM deviations.","From now on, I will take more time to review the radar picture with the Captain and discuss possible scenarios that may arise. Second, whenever flying along the East Coast, I will plot VORs along the coast in the 'fix' pages of the FMS with a 50 mile ring. Tomorrow I will experiment and see if the secondary flight plan built with VORs along the coast will allow a 50 mile course offset which would effectively give a 50 mile limitation line.","800, 25000, 26000, 30000","800","25000",FALSE
"179","Descending on the DIRTY3 Arrival at FL330 in moderate precipitation, visibility zero in clouds, night IMC, we experienced moderate chop to light turbulence. Crew discussed and requested a descent below turbulence. ATC cleared us to descend to FL290. We had turbulence throughout descent. Highest level of automation selected. VNAV SPEED descended aircraft at 2,500-3,000 FPM.I was looking at my EFB to verify proper approach was loaded in FMC and to review approach and taxi diagrams. Was having trouble reading the charts due to turbulence and lighting. At approximately FL315 we received a TCAS alert, 'traffic, monitor vertical speed.' Almost immediately followed by 'adjust vertical speed, adjust.' This caused me to look again at the automation and altitude set in MCP. Based upon our descent rate which was quite high I elected to disconnect the autopilot and autothrottles in order to comply with the alert. The aircraft was trimmed with high nose down pressure at the time of disconnect.At this time my First Officer informed me that there was traffic below us and we should probably climb. By the time I could get my bearings due to the turbulence and weather conditions (we estimated about three seconds) we then received a TCAS RA 'Climb' alert. The turbulence and weather conditions at the time of event certainly caused a distraction and brief second or two of confusion as I transitioned to the PFD guidance.I added power and reversed direction to initiate a climb. I believe we were just above FL290 when the climb was initiated. I climbed to about 30,600 feet MSL. At about FL300 I recall hearing 'clear of conflict.' I also heard (another carrier) aircraft on the arrival report to ATC that they had received a RA climb alert as well. We reported to ATC that we also had a RA climb and were leveling off. ATC advised that there was (another carrier) aircraft at FL280 and cleared us to descend back down to FL290.I alerted company Dispatch via ACARS and also called them upon landing to see if they needed more information.In hindsight after verifying that the automation was correctly set, I might have done better to first attempt responding to the TCAS alert by transitioning to MCP vertical speed to correct the problem. However, due to the turbulence and descent rate at the time of the initial alert I wasn't confident that the aircraft would capture altitude hold at our clearance limit of FL290. I now believe that turning off all automation prior to the RA climb command with the poor weather and turbulence and the nose trimmed down for a rapid descent may have compounded the problem. I also could have set a more comfortable descent rate earlier by selecting vertical speed. Once I verified the automation was properly set, I made a poor decision to focus my attention to the arrival and approach charts when I should have been monitoring my primary flight instruments. After debriefing the event with the First Officer we agreed that we were caught off guard by the changing information being provided by TCAS. In the heat of the moment I remember hearing 'adjust vertical speed, adjust' and was not confident that the aircraft would capture FL290 due to the ride conditions. I made a split-second decision to disconnect automation and this may or may not have compounded the extreme workload we were experiencing.","At approximately FL315 we received a TCAS alert, 'traffic, monitor vertical speed.' Almost immediately followed by 'adjust vertical speed, adjust.' The Captain almost immediately disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles in order to comply with the alert.As he was doing this, I scaled down my map and mentioned the traffic is below us. As I was digesting the information I was seeing on the displays (while being bumped around quite a bit) I noticed the Captain was descending more rapidly than before the RA. It took me about two or three seconds of this before I corrected the Captain and told him we needed to climb not descend. I hesitated because I questioned myself on what I was actually seeing. As soon as I called out the error to the Captain, he corrected the attitude and complied with the RA.","28000, 29000, 30000, 30600, 31500, 33000","29000","31500",FALSE
"187","Started our flight at a cruise altitude of FL330 started to get bumpy about 15 minutes into cruise. Then moderate turbulence I told Flight Attendants (FAs) to be seated.  Made a PA about suspending service, changed Altitude to FL310, better ride for 5 minutes, Changed Altitude again to FL290, reduced IAS to 290. Then to descended to FL270. Finally found a smooth ride, waited 5 minutes, called the FAs, told them that I was going to keep the Seat belt sign on, but it should be ok for them to start moving in the galley, don't bring the carts out the aisle yet and see where this ride will go.  Almost 5 minutes later we encountered moderate Turbulence for 5-10 seconds, then 30 Seconds of severe turbulence, followed by 1 minute of moderate turbulence, commanded the FAs to take their jumpseats over the PA. We were able to get a lower altitude of FL250, Aircraft (AC) was stable called the Purser to find out if everyone was alright. She explained that all the Passengers were down and ok, but that [a flight attendant] had injured his knee, wrist and bumped his head, and that [another flight attendant] hurt his Ribs and maybe back.  I talked to them about deviating or to ask if there was, any medical personnel on board who could help evaluate them, we decided to continue on.  They all agreed to continue, but to have EMTs meet the AC [at destination], to help evaluate them, and see the extent of injury and go to clinic or hospital if necessary. Notified Dispatch with multiple messages, while notifying Dispatch of our situation and notifying [medical services] for us, while relaying the info, got messages from [Company] Flt. ops manger, [flight operations], Ops manager in ORD, and [maintenance] about the Severe Turbulence, asking if I referenced the Quick reference Guide (QRG) yet for the Turbulence action guide.  All the while sending multiple messages asking the names, file number then age of my FAs, info that is readily available to them, while we were managing the AC for the remainder of the flight. Because REMF at FL250 was showing about 3.2 thousand pounds. Not a very safe option. To many messages about info that they already had if they just took a moment to think about the messages I sent to dispatch. Also, trying to get better information from ATC as far as rides went was difficult, because each controller had a different story as far as rides and altitude. 10-15 later I made a PA to the Passengers about what happened and that the AC was fine and my FAs had been banged up a little, but we were going to continue on.Approximately 20-30 minutes later I talked to the FAs again to make sure they were alright, and explained to them what happened on our end and the messages sent. Then I asked if they were really ok, because I explained to them that they were running on adrenaline, and might not feel yet, but if things change please let us know. So we continued to MCO. P.S. Original flight had us at FL310 Climbing to FL350 through that area, with a Flight Plan REMF of 6,000 pounds.","We took off at XA:00. We were planned at FL310 until WEEDS and leveled off there. We were supposed to later climb to 350 then 370. At that time we turned off the fasten belts sign off and were discussing the forecasted turbulence ahead. As we switched frequencies we would inquire on the rides. As we flew farther east we started to hear reports of bad rides above us. We passed WEEDS and decided to stay at 310. One sector reported rides from 340-390 were getting moderate and 330-290 were light. We turned on the fasten belts sign and I believe at some point we climbed to 330. At some point the turbulence started and he told the flight attendants to secure all carts and be seated. We then encountered moderate and even just a few seconds of what I might've called severe. We reported the moderate turbulence to ATC and asked for immediate descent to 270. We had a rough ride on the way down and then everything seemed to smooth out at 270. After several minutes of smooth and maybe an occasional light ripple, he called the flight attendants and told them they could get up, but not to get any carts out. At that time there were no adverse PIREPS from other aircraft at 270 or below. I did not object to letting them up and did not question his judgment. I'd say about 3-5 minutes after that, at approximately XA:45 and 15 miles West of ICT I noticed the VSI trending into a climb and our airspeed started to increase. I recognized this as wave and began to pull the thrust back to maintain airspeed. Shortly after that the aircraft shook violently and I was thrown against my seat belt and reached up to grab the controls. The FMA showed auto throttle on, lateral mode of CWS and ALT HOLD. My best guess is the aircraft rolled about 20-30 degrees and I made the necessary control inputs to get back to wings level and then proceeded to put the plane back into LNAV/VNAV. We reported the turbulence to ATC as moderate to severe and requested a descent to 250. The severe turbulence may have lasted 30 seconds or so at the most. When everything was calm at 250 he called the back and spoke to the flight attendants. We became aware that [two flight attendants] in the aft galley had been injured and they determined they could and would like to continue to MCO. I did not hear most of the conversation, but the lead flight attendant was advocating for them to receive medical attention upon landing. We then reported the incident to dispatch and over the next hour or so answered various questions from dispatch, [flight operations] and [maintenance]. Besides being a little shaken up, the rest of the flight continued safely and normally. We eventually climbed up I believe to a maximum of 350 when we returned to smooth air well east of the forecasted and reported turbulence area to achieve a desirable REMF. We left the fasten belts sign on for the remainder of the flight. When we landed the passengers deplaned and [the injured flight attendants] were attended to by EMS in the jet bridge.

"189","While climbing through approximately FL220, I mentioned the poor climb performance we were getting with only 35 people in an XR. (700 FPM and 230 knots and accelerating very slowly). At around FL280 we observed an airspeed discrepancy flag. The First Officer (FO) began going through the QRH, while I flew. Near FL370 we were still troubleshooting when we began noticing rapidly changing differences in airspeed and altitude. We were IMC. My side began overspeeding while the FO side was 50 or 60 knots less. I turned off the autopilot and we requested a descent and [advised ATC]. We were cleared to FL240. We observed only one abnormal message on EICAS descending through about FL290, 'Interconnected Weight On Wheels Inoperative'. We followed the guidance for descending with unreliable airspeed. We agreed we needed a VFR airport to divert to. At around 10000 feet my airspeed and altitude indications rapidly returned to something more normal. We continued visually and landed. The threats are fairly obvious. I think we should have decided sooner to stop the climb, however the deviations were relatively small until the last 1000 feet or so. We [advised ATC] very quickly which helped us out as far as getting a quick decent and help from ATC locating an airport. I think that another threat may have been very little cut and dried procedures for this type of event that was clearly marked/located in the QRH.Turn the autopilot off, follow standby instruments immediately and not try to figure out which side is right or wrong. I think there should be an easy to find procedure with all the info needed in one spot for this abnormal.","We took off with no problems. Upon passing through FL220 we noticed the aircraft not climbing very well. We were getting about 700 feet per minute in an XRJ. We talked about it and noticed the airspeeds didn't match. As we progressed, the airspeed deviations started to grow. We now turned to the QRH to seek guidance. The Captain side PFD was showing close to overspeed, while my side was showing slowing. We were now through FL360 with 1000 feet to go. The plane was stating high speed from the Captain side, but we were still slowing. We decided to [advise ATC] and started an immediate descent. I told ATC that we needed to be VFR soon as we could not trust our primary instruments. We decided on a diversion airport [that] was VFR and descended visually. Around 10,000 feet the Captain side started to respond to the blockage and things started to scroll back to their proper values. We landed without incident and reported to maintenance.Losing our Pitot-Static system on both of our PFD's causing us to rely on VFR flight rules and our backup instruments.","700, 1000, 10000, 22000, 24000, 28000, 29000, 36000, 37000","1000","22000",FALSE
"202","Enroute to SAT during descent, we encountered turbulence bordering on severe. The only turbulence forecast for route of flight was for the [departure] area. As part of preflight briefing, I instructed the flight attendants that while previous pilots had informed us there was a smooth ride into [departure airport], they should remain seated until I gave them a call. I also used [weather forecast] to brief the FO on weather along our route of flight. [Weather forecast] displayed the briefed turbulence over [departure airport]; some significant weather well east of our route of flight and a possible (very thin line) of rain showers around Abilene.We let the flight attendants up at FL 330. Enroute to SAT north of Abilene, I switched the radar on (we could see the storms off to the east (75 miles). During the descent passing FL 290, I observed ground obscuration of indeterminate height and we asked ATC about the rides in the descent. We were told there were no adverse reports. Believing the obscuration to be associated with the low ceiling I told the flight attendants we were concerned about the lower clouds and that we were at FL270 and 109 miles from the airport and that they should clean the cabin and sit down and we would ding them again at 10,000 feet for the 10,000 feet announcement. Passing 250 we began to encounter clouds and light turbulence, so I called the flight attendants again, apologized told them they better take their seats and we would try to find time to clean the cabin on the other side of the clouds. The FA A announced 'flight attendants take your seats'.We leveled at 240, for a short period the ride smoothed out then we were cleared to STONEWALL ONE at 10,000 feet. At this time descent speed was set for 280 and I was maintaining approximately 270 knots. We were also still using the radar adjusting angle for elevation with radar now set to the 80 mile scale. Passing FL190 we observed more clouds along our route of flight and now small cells started to pop up on our radar with several 10 miles left and one cell four miles right of our route of flight. We asked ATC for a deviation left of course of five degrees; radar scale was now reduced to 20-40 miles with angle between minus .5 to plus1, passing 17,000 feet a very small cell (1/4 mile in diameter) popped up on radar directly in front of our route of flight and 1/2 mile ahead. Entering the clouds we encountered a couple of bumps of light turbulence followed a few seconds later by moderate and occasional turbulence bordering on severe lasting five to eight seconds.We exited the cloud and I called to ask the flight attendants if everything was okay. The B and C informed me that they were not okay and that the C had hit her head and they were assessing the situation. We informed ATC of the turbulence waited two minutes then asked the flight attendants about their condition. They informed us they were okay (with the head bump) we asked if there were any issues/injuries in the cabin and were again informed no. We asked if they wanted to have the paramedics meet them (the flight attendants) and were informed no. We spoke with the flight attendants one more time during the descent prior to 10,000 feet. Subsequently, the flight attendants notified us that they would like the paramedics to meet them at the aircraft. The paramedics evaluated the B and C flight attendants and determined that an immediate hospital visit was not required. The C reported that she had hit her head and the B stated she had injured her back when she fell out of her seat. At the hotel, I provided both flight attendants with my contact information and asked them to let me know if they required additional medical assistance.","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","250, 290, 10000, 17000, 19000, 27000, 29000, 33000","10000","17000",FALSE
"204","Captain was the Pilot Flying (PF) and First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring. We were told by the Final Approach Controller: 'Maintain 5000 feet until JAAJJ, cleared for the ILS PRM Runway 8L and maintain 180 knots until the marker'. Between JAAJJ and BAZAR and at 4000 feet MSL, the PF called for Landing Gear down and flaps 15 followed shortly thereafter by flaps 30 and slowed to final approach speed (148 knots). After passing BAZAR, the Tower Controller told us to maintain 180 knots until the marker. At that time, the PF sped up to only 158 knots, so as not to overspeed the flaps. Just prior to the marker (SCHEL), the Tower Controller cancelled our approach clearance, told us to turn 20 degrees left and climb to 4000 feet. When switching back to the Approach Controller, he asked us if there was a reason why we slowed early and didn't maintain 180 knots to the marker. I (PF) responded with 'Nope'. The PF thought that FOM/AOM procedures say we have to be fully configured and on speed by the marker and that ATL's clearance would have him violating that. I tried to tell him that's not procedure anymore and we just have to be stabilized at 1000 feet. However, I didn't feel like that was the appropriate time to discuss who was right, so I didn't do anything to try and make him speed up. I knew it wasn't safety related other than Company who was originally five miles behind and losing that spacing. I knew how strict ATL is with speed control due to the numerous RBFs and safety bulletins put out about this.","We were cleared for the ILS PRM 8L, and to maintain 180 knots to the marker. I heard the Flight Attendants say we had a Passenger up in the lav, and due to wanting to slow down on speed to be more controlled in the turbulence and thunderstorms, I slowed the aircraft down approx 2.5 miles before the marker.

"205","After takeoff Aft Flight attendant called to inform us of a cabin odor. This was the first flight of the day and it rained all night so we thought it might dissipate after a short time. We leveled at FL190 and were in need of Engine Heat. With that the smell returned and was stronger. We could smell it in the cockpit, my eyes started to burn and the First Officer said he had a headache. We did the QRH procedure. Informed the dispatcher via ACARS. Our destination was so we proceeded to destination. Short hold for sequence then landed. At the gate I met with the crew and all of us had symptoms, so we called EMS to evaluate our conditions, which led to a trip to the hospital for checkup. EMS personnel entered the aircraft at the gate and had to leave because of burning eyes and throat. Evaluation dictated not to fly for 2 days. I've had cabin odor before but this was the worst by far.","After the 10,000 feet level off announcement I went towards the back of the aircraft to begin the service. 1/2 way down the aisle I smelled a strong 'dirty sock' odor which got stronger as I got closer to the back galley. The 'B' flight attendant asked if I smelled the odor, which I confirmed. 'A' flight attendant was notified who in turn notified the flight deck. Over the course of maybe the next 15-20 minutes the smell subsided somewhat. (Never completely went away), but 1/2 way through the flight the odor came back even stronger than initially, this time more irritating. The flight deck was notified again by the 'A' flight attendant. This time they stated it was noted in the cockpit as well.  I developed a headache and sore throat and eyes. Very strong pungent 'dirty sock' odor in cabin during takeoff (it dissipated somewhat-never went away-just lessened) but came back even stronger midway through the flight.

"207","Close to CTB VOR we encountered severe turbulence at FL350.We had heard reports 'pockets of moderate turbulence 100 east of MLP VOR'.  We were in the clear and smooth air.  Our position was just west of CTB VOR (approximately 140nm east and 70nm north of the reported turbulence). I decided to put the seat belt sign on.  I called the flight attendants and told them to take their jump seats.  The purser answered and said the other two were in the aisle and she would communicate that to them.  I also made a PA that they should take their jump seats.  I am told they immediately began that process of taking the carts toward the back of the aircraft.Before the aft flight attendants could get the carts stowed and in their seats we encountered severe turbulence.  I am guessing the time frame from my communicating to the flight attendants and the turbulence was in the 3-5 minute range.  It began with a mountain wave speed increase that went up to approximately 10 knots above Vmo.  The First Officer (FO) stated he saw .83 Mach, although it may have been higher.  The severe turbulence began almost simultaneously as the airspeed increased.Our altitude went up to an observed 35,700 and down to 34,000 feet before the FO had control of the aircraft.  Bank angles went up to approximately 25 degrees in both directions as the altitude and airspeed varied.  The First Officer was flying as the autopilot disconnected due to high-speed protection mode.  I was attempting to talk to ATC but communication was difficult due to the aircraft movement.  Once I established communication we were cleared continued down to FL310.   I advised ATC of the turbulence and the inability of controlling our altitude.Once we were out of this situation I contacted the flight attendants to see if we had any injuries.  We had one flight attendant injured by the food cart landing on her leg.   No passengers reported any injuries.  I am told the carts rose up under a foot in the turbulence.  The purser was able to just get in her seat as it began.  The turbulence lasted 30 -45 seconds in my estimate (it is only an estimate).The flight attendant injured her leg. It was cut and scraped from the cart.  A nurse was on the flight. She went and checked on her and her partner.  They determined it was ok to continue destination.  They both stated they hit their heads, without any signs of concussion are what I was told.We wrote up the observed airspeed deviation as well as the turbulence encounter.","Airspeed began rapidly increasing and the plane began to climb, eventually reaching at least FL357 before nosing over to descend. Autopilot kicked off as the plane was being rocked to approximately 20 degrees bank on either side. We saw at least 10 knots overspeed, and .83 mach, which lasted for 30-45 seconds.

"217","Deice and anti-ice in blocks. Push back and engine start then called for 'after engine start check list'. FO asked for engine anti ice 'on', and I called for it to be 'on'. ATC happened to call us for a runway change at that very same time. FO answered ATC and we proceeded to reconfigure the FCP and FMS flight plan. Taxi, take off, and climb were normal. Just as we leveled at FL310, we received an ECAM alert, 'Pack #1 and Pack #2 fault', which requires us to turn both packs off. Followed ECAM and realized we would depressurize, asked ATC for lower altitude of 10,000 ft and to return to ZZZZ. Started our descent and a turn back to ZZZZ. Passing around FL220, I scanned the overhead panel, while the FO worked the FMS, and noticed the APU and APU bleed air valve were still 'on'. I turned the APU bleed air valve off and the aircraft pressurized back to normal. Requested ATC to level off at FL200, checked fuel status, and we decided to continue to [destination]. ATC granted us clearance back on route and a climb back up to altitude. No emergency was declared and ATC was very helpful. As I described the event above, our normal flow pattern was interrupted and we missed some key items on the 'after start check list'.This was a situation with an easy fix. It could have turned out much different. Checklists are important, not only for normal operation of aircraft systems, but for safety itself. I am just as much to blame for not scanning the overhead panel before takeoff and assuming check lists [and] switches are complied with and not confirming that they are. I will have to make an effort make sure I scan the ECAM MEMO page and overhead panels before each take off.

"228","This report is in reference to a severe turbulence encounter. We flew down from our destination earlier and were cognizant of the convective activity around the area. We decided to hold west of the field and analyze the movement of the weather which was between us and the runway extending north to south for twenty miles. Other aircraft followed us into the hold.We saw a break in the line to the south of the field and flew until we could turn to the final approach fix and executed the RNAV approach. We picked up the field at 1,400 MSL and landed without incident. The weather worsened while at the gate with heavy rain and strong winds. I spoke with our Dispatcher on a plan for departure. He suggested FL280 for a better ride. We previously flew down at FL 390 and it was continuous light with some moderate turbulence.At taxi out, we decided to hold short of the departure runway and wait for the storms to move through. After considerable improvement in the weather we taxied on to the runway and made a radar sweep. The departure corridor looked excellent. We departed and climbed to FL 280. We requested a westerly deviation and were eight miles from our original track. We were well clear of any cells. I turned back on course after analyzing the radar. Out of nowhere we hit an area of severe turbulence which lasted for 3-5 seconds.The autopilot remained engaged and altitude varied plus or minus 200 feet. I immediately made a PA announcement for the Flight Attendants (FAs) to take their seats. I was informed by our Purser that she was thrown to the floor and the B FA was on the aft galley floor unable to get up. I told her to see if a Doctor was on board to help. Fortunately there was. I then reassured our customers that this was an isolated occurrence and to remain seated for the remainder of the flight.We conducted an HF phone patch with Dispatch to discuss the event that transpired. After receiving the B FAs vitals and condition, it was decided to continue to the destination. The physician had our FA stabilized in the last row. The flight continued and landed where medical personnel met our aircraft and transported our B FA to the hospital. The A FA had a lot of back pain but stayed on the trip. Our C FA also had back pain and got off the trip the following day. During deplaning a passenger told me she injured her thumb and ear during the turbulence and wanted medical evaluation. However, one of our crew members talked to her after we left the sterile period and she showed her the black and blue thumb before the incident happened. Also, she claimed to have hurt her left ear on the cabin sidewall but was seated in seat 14F.

"234","We were enroute.  We had flown earlier that day and knew there was some turbulence in the area.  Looking at the weather packet, we only noted an area of Moderate along our route from FL340 to FL390.  The Captain asked the Flight Attendants to remain seated until he called them enroute.  During the climb out, we did experience some Light Turbulence, and asked ATC about the rides.  They said that FL 390 and above had been reported as 'good ride.'We leveled off at FL390 and did have a 'good ride' (only small areas of light chop.) The Captain told the Flight Attendants they could start their service.  The flight continued to be mostly smooth so the Captain turned the seatbelt sign off.  From that point on, we did not received any adverse ride reports.  We had the radar on for most of the flight and were showing no weather ahead.  We were given an initial decent to FL350 with a crossing restriction of 11,000 feet at KAYLA.  The Captain turned the seatbelt sign ON for the descent.  We never leveled off at FL350 because we were already high for a crossing restriction. We were asked to keep the speed up.  With the huge tailwind, I transitioned 310 knots to maintain the flight path. The descent was not turbulent and we had not heard any other aircraft reporting adverse rides.  At approximately FL210, we encountered Moderate Turbulence and the airspeed quickly jumped up 20 knots and showing trend into Vmo.  I pulled back on the yolk to stop the descent; the autothrottles were already at idle.  The Captain asked Flight Attendants to take their seats over the PA.  The airspeed responded just under 340 knots.  It seemed we were in the clear and it had been small sheer zone.  We then encountered Severe Turbulence at approximately FL 200. The airspeed instantly increased from around 310 to 340-350. I immediately pulled back on yolk to slow plane down and thrust lever were still at idle.  The airspeed was slow to respond.  I eventually got it slowed to 280 and we continued descent. The plane was continuously jolted and banked abruptly.  The whole encounter lasted about three to four minutes. At approximately FL 180 we were clear of the severe turbulence.  The Flight Attendant called the Captain and told him the aft Flight Attendant injured her ankle trying to get to her seat.  The Captain reported the Severe Turbulence to ATC and Dispatch. We were given relief on the crossing restriction. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The paramedics met us at gate and attended to the injured Flight Attendant. There were no other injuries report to us.","Enroute with the Flight Attendants seated until approximately 15 minutes into the cruise flight due to turbulence. Approximately 30 minutes later, we were given a descent. Prior to the Top of Descent, I turned the seatbelt sign on as it had previously been off due to smooth rides.

As we passed 20,000 feet we encountered Severe Turbulence with large fluctuations in airspeed and attitude. The Severe Turbulence lasted approximately two to three minutes and did not stop until we left 18,000 feet. Shortly after, the A Flight Attendant informed us that Flight Attendant had been hurt and would require medical assistance upon our arrival at the gate. I informed Operations and they complied with our request. We had no indications from Air Traffic Control or our weather packet that would indicate such ride conditions existed. Furthermore, we had no indication visually or on our weather radar of Severe Turbulence. I reported our encounter to Air Traffic Control as well as our Dispatcher through ACARS for any and all aircraft in the area. We landed without further incident and the injured Flight Attendant was removed by medical personnel.

I would say that fatigue was the primary culprit. When we read back the clearance it should have seemed an unusual alt to intercept at, as the minimum alt at RACYR is 2600 ft.

I could not pick up a Class B clearance on the ground. While climbing and turning to the north I maintained an altitude of 3500 ft to stay underneath the class B shelf at 3800 ft. As I approached Barona Casino VPSBC I requested a frequency change from the SEE tower controller so I could contact SoCal Approach to pick up flight following. I planned to stay below the Class B airspace and did not ask for a Bravo clearance. I was over Barona Casino VPSBC while continuing a slow climb as I continued to pass under the Class B 3800 ft shelf then staying below the Class B 4800 ft shelf. During this time I had initiated my communication with SoCal. I was also encountering some turbulence. I was confirming my position on my charts when I received the call back from SoCal.

I checked the altimeter and I was still just above 3500 ft - 300 ft below the Class D airspace ceiling. However, the SoCal controller told me my climb to 4500 ft was approved and I climbed to clear the Class D airspace. I believe I did not give myself enough time to complete the needed task of initiating communication with Approach control. Since I was also in unfamiliar terrain I was occupied by referencing my charts multiple times. I was also distracted by the turbulence. Even though I had planned my departure route and altitudes carefully prior to flying that day I realized I didn't give myself enough buffer zone (distance, time and altitude) to establish communication with ATC.","","300, 3500, 3800, 4500, 4800, 14000","3800","3500",FALSE
"246","The altitude deviation occurred while being vectored to final for the ILS 19R into MKE. While on a base vector I noticed that neither of our ghost needles had popped up so I went heads down into the FMS to make sure the right approach was loaded. It was not so I began loading the ILS 19R during the high workload situation. The most current altitude clearance at that time was to 2800 feet which was the GS intercept altitude. At some point while loading the correct approach we were given a new clearance with an intercept heading of 220, maintain 2800 feet until established, cleared for the ILS 19R approach. Once established on final ATC reiterated to maintain 2800 feet at which point I looked at the altitude selector set to 2100 feet for unknown reasons. I replied to ATC that we were climbing back up to 2800 feet at which point he sent us over to tower.The deviation was brought to our attention when ATC repeated that our clearance was to maintain 2800 until established. At that point I looked at the altitude selector and saw the wrong altitude selected. The event occurred because I was fixing a mistake I made earlier in the flight, my first officer was task saturated, and we did not follow SOP for altitude changes and confirmation. I was not made aware or realized that he had selected a new altitude in the altitude selector. We climbed back up to our assigned altitude and continued the approach with no further issues. This could have been prevented had I not been distracted by the FMS and we had followed SOPs when selecting a new altitude.","I was almost task saturated due to low experience level in light ice, turbulence, and full IMC approach together. Continuous changes of headings and altitudes brought me to incorrectly select 2100ft on the altitude selector. In the future I will overcome confusion by reinforcing altitude selections and confirmation procedures as stated in [company] manuals.The event occurred because PM had selected an incorrect approach early on during flight and was focusing on fixing it during final vectors moments of the approach. I was task saturated and incorrectly select wrong altitude without confirmation from PM as SOPs procedures require. After descent to 2100ft we realized it was a lower altitude than the minimums for the approach and climbed back up to 2800ft.

We were contacting ZZZ radio on HF for further climb clearance to FL380 when we encountered moderate turbulence for approximately 10 seconds. The flight conditions were smooth and showed nothing on the radar prior to and after this event. The Flight Attendants (FA) were preparing for the initial food and beverage service. Post turbulence I was informed by the 'A' FA of injuries to a flight attendant involving her ankle and 2 cuts on her face from a beverage cart. As soon as time permitted I requested the door to be blocked so I could go back and check on her myself. She seemed comfortable and had her leg up and ankle on ice.I was not aware until landing that 2 other FAs were additionally injured, one who complains of hurt back and one who complained of a knee injury.","","24000, 38000","24000","24000",TRUE
"9","Encountered moderate to severe turbulence about 30 miles north of OMN. Aircraft then entered a downdraft and lost 700 feet of altitude in about 10 seconds. ATC called and said to maintain FL300, we told ATC we were in turbulence and a down draft. Aircraft climbed back to FL300.","We were in cruise flight at FL300. Radar was in calibrated and auto mode. There were some light green returns on the radar on our right side but no different than returns we had seen for the last 100 or so miles while getting a good ride. We were about 30 NM north of the OMN VOR and started to get moderate turbulence, then got an updraft which pushed us up about 200 feet followed by a significant downdraft which caused us to lose 700 feet. The aircraft was on autopilot the entire time and the FMA showed ALT CRUISE. We got a burst or two of moderate rain which caused significant radio static which is a common problem in the Airbus. I could barely hear the controller say to maintain FL300 to which I replied that we were in moderate and greater turbulence. She responded to return to FL300 as soon as possible. There was no traffic showing on the TCAS at the time. The altitude loss was probably a duration of one minute or so from the time the downdraft began until we were back at FL300.I can only guess that a rapidly growing cell was below us. The new radar in the advanced airbuses does seem to sometimes paint WX less severe than the older radars when in the calibrated position. We were in an area with a lot of other aircraft on basically the same route and no one was deviating or reporting significant turbulence. There were no injuries. I would call the turbulence moderate to severe. The jolts were moderate but downdraft was similar to a mountain wave in that the aircraft could not overpower it but the ride during the altitude loss was not terribly violent.Although not a causative factor in this incident, the airbus radio static problem should be looked into. Whenever you are in cold precipitation it is sometimes impossible to communicate due to the static. I have never experienced that to this degree in 23,000 hours in many types of aircraft. I can only conclude it's a design flaw.","200, 700, 30000","30000","30000",TRUE
"17","On January 2015, between XA:00 EST and January [next day], XB:00 EST, an emergency was advised by Air Traffic Control for Aircraft X, an Aero Commuter 500 due to my need to escape an encounter with severe icing. The following is my account of the event, to the best of my memory. After rechecking the weather and NOTAMS at ZZZ1 and ZZZ, I started the aircraft at XA:27 EST. While taxing to runway 23, I turned the TKS system on to the normal setting and noted that the high pressure light was bright yellow. I contacted Center and obtained my clearance. I was cleared as filed, up to 8000 MSL. Prior to my departure, I did one last check of the weather at ZZZ1 and though the ceiling had lowered from the time of my arrival, the temperature was a few degrees above freezing. ZZZ was reporting marginal VFR with 10 miles of Visibility, scattered clouds around 1700 AGL, with overcast around 2000 AGL. I departed at XA:31 EST.I flew the published departure which is a climbing right turn to R270 off of ZZZ1 to 4400 MSL then on course. At 4400 MSL I contacted Center. After several minutes they responded '[Aircraft X], radar contact, climb to 8000, precede direct HVQ.' My climb was slow and it was difficult to maintain heading and airspeed due to moderate turbulence and a 40+ kt headwind. After passing through 5500 MSL I noticed my groundspeed was 97 kts. Knowing that the winds were stronger above 6000 MSL, I requested from Center to level at 6000. After 4 or 5 minutes at 6000 MSL I noticed my airspeed had dropped from 170 MPH, to 165 MPH. I then took my flashlight and shined it on the wings. The spinner had roughly 2 inches of Rime ice, the props were starting to coat with ice from the root to the edge of the ice strip, [and] the wings were covered from the top to the bottom of the leading edge with about an inch and a half of Rime ice. While inbound to ZZZ1 from ZZZ2, I was able to get on top of the clouds at 10,000 MSL. It was clear above 10,000 MSL to the stars, with negative ice. This was my first out. Also, while inbound to ZZZ1, the freezing rain and sleet turned to rain only while I was passing 4,800 MSL and ZZZ was marginal. That was my second out. Knowing that the wind speeds were higher above 6000 MSL, and seeing how much ice had already accumulated in the amount of time it took for me to climb to 6000 MSL, I determined that the amount of time it would take me to climb to 10,000 MSL, and the rate of which I was accumulating ice, I would not be able to make it to 10,000 feet. At this time I elected to go to my second out and turned the TKS to Maximum. I asked Center how low they could get me and informed them I was picking up ice at a rate faster than I could shed it. The controller then said the lowest he could give me was 5900. I told the controller that I would take it and started down the one hundred feet. The controller then said he could get me lower if I flew a 270 heading for 15 miles. I was hesitant to take it because I knew it would lengthen my time enroute to ZZZ but decided to take it after seeing that I was still accumulating ice on the wings and props. The controller then cleared me to an altitude that was only a few hundred feet less. Then, a minute or so later, he cleared me to an altitude less than 5000 and gave me a heading of 300. Several minutes later he asked for a ride report. I grabbed my flashlight again and checked the wings, props, and spinner. The ice had increased since I checked it last, and since turning the TKS to Maximum. I also noted that my airspeed had dropped 10 MPH in the last 5 minutes. I then explained all of this to the controller and he gave me a heading of 310 and said to contact ZZZ and that they would be able to get me lower. I contacted ZZZ and asked if I could get direct to the airport and asked what the lowest he could give me would be. He cleared me direct and said the lowest he could give me was 3500 feet (I think) but said he could get me lower when I got closer. I took the 3500 and noticed that the airspeed was dropping at an alarming rate. I continued towards ZZZ and a couple of minutes later my airspeed was down to 129 MPH. I then told the ZZZ controller that I needed lower. It was then that he [registered] me [as] an emergency and gave me a descent to 3000. I accepted the clearance and went down to 3000. A few miles further the controller gave me 2200 MSL and I descended. The controller offered me an altitude that would've been 50 feet above the mountains, which I think was 1700 MSL, but I told him I was not going any lower until I was within 10 miles of the airport. Knowing that the temperature at ZZZ1 was above freezing and the elevation is just under 3000, along with the fact that ZZZ was reporting overcast above 2000 AGL and temps above freezing, I thought I would get out of the ice faster than I did. However, it was not until I got a visual of ZZZ that I began to shed the ice. Normally, when the ice begins to come off it sounds like one of the switches on the overhead panel being turned off, or like a circuit breaker popping. This time it sounded more like cannon balls hitting the side of the aircraft. When I was about seven miles south of ZZZ, I was able to call the visual. It took 3 6 second bursts of TKS on the windscreen, and until I was short final for runway 23, for the pilots side of the windscreen to clear. By the time I landed, most of the wings were clear. I landed in ZZZ with no flaps and long at XB:23 EST. The tower had alerted the emergency trucks and they were waiting for me. After I had the aircraft under control on the runway the tower gave me taxi instructions. The trucks followed me to parking. After parking and shutting the aircraft down at XB:24, I got out and was met by the emergency responders. Because the copilots windscreen and the nose were not touched by the TKS, they still had substantial build up. One of the responders asked if the same amount of ice that was on the nose and windscreen was on the wings and I told him yes but it was worse. He then said that was the most ice he had seen on an aircraft that landed. I then answered some questions about my flight from the head responder and gave him my personal information, certificate number, and phone number. I then called my Chief Pilot.","","3500, 4400, 4800, 5500, 6000, 8000, 10000","6000","6000",TRUE
"24","During preflight, the Captain and I looked at radar imagery and discussed a massive area of storms moving across our planned STAR, as well as a smaller scattered area of storms popping up near our destination. Our planned arrival fuel was 7,000 lbs. An alternate was neither required by regulations nor filed. The Captain coordinated with dispatch to add another 2,000 lbs. of fuel.During cruise, we monitored the destination ATIS. It alternated between VFR/no precipitation, and IMC/TSRA. We were filed and cleared for the AYBID transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. Due to weather, Jacksonville Center re-cleared us direct HURDE, which was on the OMN transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. We advised dispatch. As we approached HURDE, there was a large area of moderate/heavy precipitation west of the arrival, broken areas of moderate precipitation southeast of us, and scattered areas of light/moderate precipitation with some turbulence markers in front of us along the arrival. There was a thunderstorm over PBI, with other scattered areas of thunderstorms moving toward it as well. Our plan was to pick our way through the weather, then hold until the storm over PBI moved, or divert to FLL. FLL was VFR and no weather was south of PBI.In rapid succession, the following happened:-ATC advised us of another airline flight reporting severe turbulence while attempting to arrive at PBI. We instructed the flight attendants to take their seats.-ATC advised us of hail in a large cell 20 nm SW of HURDE, which was moving toward HURDE due to wind.-Another airline flight in the area reported moderate turbulence and turned around.-Another airline flight on the arrival started asking for large deviations around weather.We asked for a 30 degree left turn to avoid a cell in front of us. As soon as we turned, we encountered continuous moderate turbulence, moderate rain, and St. Elmo's fire. We had not yet even entered any of the precipitation painting on our radar. The gaps in the weather in front of us were closing up, and we were surrounded by weather on both the left and right sides. We asked for and were cleared for a left 180 degree turn to the north. I advised dispatch that we had to turn around and may need to divert. We were offshore, and weather extended up the east coast of Florida (off our left now) all the way up to just south of Daytona. No matter what we did next, we would need to go up to abeam Daytona before turning west. We discussed that we could possibly go north to abeam Daytona, west to the west coast of Florida, south around the weather, then east into PBI. The problem was that this would leave us with little extra fuel to hold or divert to FLL if the thunderstorm over PBI had not moved off.We discussed the situation and the captain decided we were diverting to MCO. I advised dispatch. I then saw that in response to my previous message, dispatch sent us several messages instructing us to work our way west through the weather. The worst weather was west of our position, and again, there was no way to go west until we went back north to abeam Daytona. I then was very busy reprogramming the FMC, and talking to ATC, the flight attendants, passengers, and MCO ops. The captain was very busy working our way around weather to join the arrival into MCO.I was not able to coordinate with PBI ops because they do not answer the radio. On a flight on the previous day, on this flight prior to our diversion, and later on this day on a subsequent flight, PBI ops did not answer the radio on the ground or in flight. I later confirmed with PBI ops in person that the frequency on our airport data page is correct and they claim the radio does work.When we were set up for the diversion, I had time to look at received messages from dispatch again. I saw there were numerous messages asking us to again pick our way through the weather west (incorrectly claiming it was clear that way), to divert to FLL if a diversion was necessary, and then to confirm our intentions (I had already clearly stated that we were diverting to MCO). This added to our stress because of previous management inquiry into and threat of discipline toward other pilots who have made decisions to divert contrary to company guidance.I messaged dispatch one last time, stating we were not able to comply with their request due to weather, that we were diverting to MCO, and that we would call them when we were on the ground. We were approaching 10,000 feet. We decided that the numerous, excessive messages from dispatch were becoming a serious distraction, and that we had to wait to communicate with them further until after we parked.We diverted to MCO without further difficulty and landed with, I believe, about 10,000 lbs of fuel. After parking, we checked the PBI ATIS and radar imagery. We saw there was still a storm over PBI and weather in between us and PBI. We believed we could possibly have overflown MCO arrived in the PBI area with 6,000-7,000 lbs of fuel, and then gotten into a bad situation with no further extra fuel to hold and minimal fuel to divert to FLL. This was exactly the scenario we were concerned about, and this confirmed our decision to divert to MCO.I saw there were several more messages from dispatch similar to the previous ones, and then finally a message with an amendment for our diversion to MCO based on 'the captain using authority.' The captain then called our dispatcher while I did the walk-around. The captain described the dispatcher's response to the captain's attempt to explain our concerns and decision-making. He described the dispatcher's response as rude and dismissive.We coordinated with dispatch and MCO ops regarding weather, passenger concerns, use of the tarmac delay snack kit, etc. After refueling and a brief delay for maintenance, we continued to PBI. All of the precipitation had moved off to the east by the time we departed MCO. Dispatch sent us several messages about the weather moving away during our flight to PBI. We completed the rest of our trip without further incident within our normal FDP.PBI Ops must answer the radio. Dispatch should have seen the massive area of weather moving across our arrival and the scattered area of storms over PBI and originally planned for us to arrive with more than 7,000 lbs of fuel. Dispatch could have filed us for the WLACE2 arrival into PBI to come in around the back side of the storms, which were moving east. We could have asked to be re-filed for the WLACE2 arrival. Dispatch could have kept us updated about the weather while we were enroute. We could have asked for updates about the weather while enroute. However, based on past experience, it is hit-or-miss whether dispatch will respond to such requests. Dispatch provided us no information prior to our message stating we had to turn around for weather. A proactive suggestion to request a re-route would have improved our situation. Instead, dispatch later provided us a distracting overload of information in an attempt to avoid a diversion. They attempted to convince us to follow a plan that would have burned all of our extra fuel and put us in a position with no remaining good options. The company culture causing this reversal of priorities needs to be improved.","","10000","10000","10000",TRUE
"46","The sequential breaking of the chain scenario is glaringly obvious in this situation. The plane is a club plane. A very complete pre-flight was completed prior to obtaining the IFR clearance. At the run up pad, it was discovered that the data card for the Garmin 430 was corrupted and rendered the GPS function inoperable although the com and nav functions for the VOR capabilities were working satisfactorily. There is a second nav/com (sl30) that was also working properly. This was the first go/no go decision point and the first link in the chain that broke. This being a medical transport (blood run), the pressure to continue to flight was succumbed to. An IFR clearance was obtained but amended from what was filed. Being based in the local area, the amendment was familiar but still added to the stress of the moment. The second link in the chain. Takeoff was normal, climb out was normal and cruise was set at 7000 feet on heading. South of ZZZ VOR I requested of Center a 20 degree course change to the east to avoid a buildup that extended several thousand feet above me. At that time I was VFR over the cloud layer. The request was granted and I changed course. The controller then advised that I should now turn direct ZZZZZ (GPS waypoint) to get back to the airway. It was at this point I realized that I had failed to change my equipment designator from 'G' to 'U'. Third Link in the Chain. Before I could confess and get the designator changed, ATC gave me a heading and told me to acquire the victor airway and disregard the prior order to fly direct ZZZZZ. As I got close to the airway and adjusting course to 151 degrees Center handed me off to Approach. At almost the same time I went full IMC and almost immediately started noticing ice on the windscreen and the wheel pants. I also encountered moderate turbulence and reduced power to protect the airplane structurally. I verified pitot heat, carb heat and defrost was engaged. The power adjustment required a trim adjustment to maintain altitude. My lack of attention to the heading drew the attention of ATC who reminded me of the desired heading. ATC also inquired as to my intentions for landing at ZZZ airport. The icing became worse as did the turbulence and I was becoming more and more alarmed at my seeming inability to keep the wings level and maintain heading and altitude. At one point I wondered if the icing was affecting lift on the wing which was causing the turn. I became more than worried (scared) as my heading had actually gone to 270 degrees while I was attempting to keep wings level and maintain altitude. ATC became concerned and verified my current heading and advised that I needed to get back to 151 degrees. I should have advised ATC of the situation but did not. Fourth Link in the Chain. I believe ATC surmised what was going on. Once I got the plane back on heading, ATC ordered a descent from 7000 to 5000. Soon thereafter I was ordered to 4000 and then to 3000. When I reached 3000 I went VFR. The ice began shedding from the plane and the turbulence ceased. ATC wanted me to advise when I had the [airport] weather. I was unable to get the weather before ATC told me the weather. ATC then guided me to the airport. I was able to see the airport when I was about 5 miles away at which point IFR was cancelled and I landed. Problems that were subsequently identified over and above the problems noted above include a failure to interpret and dig deeper when checking weather for the flight. Additional training on weather interpretation will be completed. More complete disclosure to ATC about the situation needed to be made. In this case it would not have changed the outcome, just the manner in which it could have been handled.","","7000","7000","7000",TRUE
"58","Approximately 3hr 10min into the flight at cruise in night IMC, FL330, coasting out of Japan within Tokyo FIR and radar contact, we encountered sudden and severe turbulence resulting in large vertical and lateral deviations. The initial event lasted several minutes, followed by two more less severe events, in total lasting perhaps 15 - 20 min. There were no SIGMETS that we were aware of, weather and windshear (w/s) data on the OFP for that segment (for FL310, we were at FL330) showed no significant w/s (4 or less). FL330 appeared to be 'in the tops' of the existing cloud layer, which showed no significant radar returns or convective activity. The weather radar system(s) appeared to be operating normally, showing appropriate ground returns etc. when cycled through range, pitch and gain settings. The first encounter was very sudden and severe, with little or no warning beyond what had been only light to moderate turbulence at the time. My first thought was that we had clipped the top of a thunderstorm cell, but there was no indication on the radar, and no lightning, hail or other weather phenomena that would indicate the presence of a thunderstorm. Initial pitch up was not extreme, but accompanied by large airspeed and altitude deviations, resulting in intermittent overspeed and stick shaker warnings. This was followed by a roll to the right of approximately 25 degrees and resulted in a 50 - 60 degree heading change and loss of LNAV capture. Observed altitude excursions were approximately +700 feet, to -500 feet from FL330. Airspeed fluctuations were too large and erratic to capture. FO, as PF, initiated recovery by disconnecting A/P and A/T and attempting to limit pitch and roll excursions and stabilize the flight path and airspeed. ATC was notified and did not report any conflict or traffic hazard in our immediate vicinity. We heard no other reports of severe turbulence on frequency, or on 121.5 mHz. There were no TCAS targets displayed nearby. Once brought back to a more stabilized path (perhaps 1 - 2min) the automation was reengaged and we again tried to determine if there were thunderstorms in the area, and again found none. A second encounter soon followed, with less severe flight path excursions, recovered in the same manner. Both events resulted in altitude and course deviations outside of regulatory limits, and were beyond our control.Some factors to consider:1. We were filed for FL310 initially as our T/O was at MGTOW. FL310 was not available from departure, we were offered FL270 or FL330. FL330 was chosen, which was the maximum for our GW. Once level we elected to use LRC over ECON initially in order to 'split the difference' between the amber bands on the airspeed indicator until our GW reduced. 3hrs later we were still in LRC which resulted in a .859m cruising speed when the turbulence was encountered. Mach .82 was entered into VNAV as soon as the automation was re-engaged, followed eventually by ECON for the remainder of the flight.2. Upset training works, FO's quick response and deliberate but smooth recovery, using techniques trained for annually, was directly responsible for the safe outcome, and undamaged aircraft, from this thankfully rare event.3. CRM/captain authority issues. CRM/TEM training works as well. While many would say hand flying in severe turbulence should be a 'captain only' event, I disagree, with certain caveats. As stated, FO was PF, yet with the first sudden encounter I also instinctively reached for the yoke and thrust levers, resulting in both pilots on the controls precisely when the need for smooth inputs is absolutely critical. Keeping that in mind, but remaining prepared, I withdrew my hands from the controls and continued as PM while FO performed the recovery. Clearly there are arguments for either case, but they are also not mutually exclusive, as I remained prepared to switch roles if I thought it was required, which I am glad to report was not the case. Bothpilots were intently focused on all aspects of the flight path, but working as a team and not in a tug of war on the controls. We don't train that way in the simulator, that is: switching roles in the middle of an upset, so we shouldn't be adding a step to the maneuver in the chaos of the real event; it is a bad time to practice a hand off, provided the PF is winning the battle.4. Fatigue/FRM. As can often happen, my rest plans did not result in the amount of sleep intended, though I was in bed in a quiet, dark room during the pre-duty rest period. The departure was late afternoon local, with full daylight for at least the first part of the flight, and we were a 3 man crew so I knew there would be a rest period. Fitness for flight is by nature a subjective call, and while I did feel somewhat tired at pick up time, I judged myself fit for duty. My practice as captain, once the PF/PM/RP duties are established, is to give first choice of rest to the PF, who in this case chose the middle rest period. As I felt sufficiently rested to stay in the seat for the first part of the flight I elected to take the last rest period. After sunset now, at 3hrs in cruise when the event began, I was experiencing some fatigue and probably was not 100% precisely when, at an instant's notice, 150% was required. I would describe this as one factor in the overall equation of this event, with perhaps the worst place for me to have been at that time would be in the bunk.Recommended practices for future events. Preparedness is the key, and planning as much as practical in terms of weather forecasts and flight planning. But, as in our case, where it was almost completely unexpected, proficient hand flying skills are the most important tool to have immediately available. My understanding is that there will be increased emphasis on real time, less scripted, training scenarios. That will likely add realism to promote greater preparedness for such extreme and unexpected events like the one we encountered.","Approximately 3 hrs into our flight while cruising at FL330 and in Tokyo FIR we suddenly encountered severe turbulence that resulted in the aircraft deviating from assigned altitude and course. Airspeed control was lost and fluctuated rapidly from over speed to stick shaker. Pitch up was not excessive but aircraft did climb rapidly and rolled and skewed violently to the right resulting in a large departure from its previous course. Maybe, 60 degrees of heading and a lateral displacement of some distance. I could not say how far with any accuracy. I disconnected all automation and attempted to recover, very mindful of not exacerbating the situation. Aircraft did not respond well to control inputs but I was able to limit the deviations initially, and then bring it back under control. As we were attempting to bring the aircraft back to course and altitude we re-engaged the automation and a few seconds later we encountered more severe turbulence that resulted in a loss of flight path control for a second, brief time. We recovered the aircraft as before and returned to course and altitude. Altitude deviations were approximately plus 700-800 and minus 500-600, lateral displacement was approximately 2-3 miles. The captain made two radio broadcasts to Tokyo to report our situation, both acknowledged by ATC. At no time prior to this were any significant radar returns seen along our route of flight. The night was dark but the sky was full of stars and no convective activity had been observed or reported. However it did appear that we were flying over a broken layer of cloud and a few of these reached our altitude. FL330 was the maximum altitude for our weight and was selected due to filed level not being available, and, our fuel load being very tight on a re-release flight plan, the alternative FL270 would have been too low. However a careful analysis before departure gave us no reason for concern and we adjusted our cruising speed, selecting LRC, to better match our situation. There were no mechanical issues with the aircraft and the radar when tested had performed as expected. My radar range was set to 80 miles prior to the event but after the first encounter I selected 40 miles and confirmed it was set to display turbulence. The aircraft performed flawlessly prior to and after the event.","500, 700, 27000, 31000, 33000","33000","33000",TRUE
"59","While being vectored on the ILS 6 into TEB we were given a descent clearance to 3,000 feet. In the descent we were also given a traffic advisory report at our 2 to 3 o'clock. As we were looking for the traffic we received a GPWS [TCAS] 'TA'. About the time we received the GPWS warning we noticed our aircraft was 450 feet low. We immediately climbed back to 3,000 feet. We continued the ILS 6 with no further issues and landed safely at TEB. The reason the deviation occurred was due to a break down in CRM. Training SOP's are very clear that as a non-flying pilot sets a new altitude in the altitude selector the flying pilot then verbally verifies the new altitude. Both pilots then verbally verify the new altitude as 'armed'. In the heat of being vectored at a low altitude in turbulence into a busy airspace while looking for close proximity aircraft we both got distracted and did not verify the 'armed' portion of that SOP. Looking forward, following the training SOP's will be the main focus for every flight to keep this from ever happening again.","","450, 3000","3000","3000",TRUE

He mentioned that when we passed 8,000 we could expect a turn to DITCH.  At some point he turned us to heading 190. I was hand flying and increased rate through 8,000 and Departure said something to the effect that traffic was no factor, cleared to DITCH.  Sometime between 8,000 and 9,000 I engaged autopilot.

"71","We were given a hold at FL380. We reduced airspeed to hold speed per FMS and Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) cards. Both pilots witnessed airspeed slowing below target speed and entered into a conversation about appropriate action. Holding leg length was increased from 10 to 15 mile legs in an attempt to reduce AOA and build speed. Throttle was set to Takeoff Go around (TOGA) power and then max power. Airspeed continued to deteriorate and First Officer (FO) requested a lower altitude. ATC advised unable. Airspeed continued to drop and we requested lower again, eventually having to make the decision to [notify ATC] and descend. Radio coverage in the area was poor, perhaps due to the weather, and ATC was unclear of our intentions/actions. We started a descent to FL370 and then got the stick shaker. At that point we made the decision to treat the event as a full blown stall and chose to continue to FL360 for airspeed, following stall recovery profile. After informing ATC of our need to descend numerous times, ATC was still confused or unaware of our intentions. The root cause of the event was an inability of the aircraft to maintain airspeed at 38,000 feet. Further complications resulted from congested airspace and poor radio coverage. To avoid this type of event in the future, holding at 38,000 feet would be avoided!","The root cause of the event was the high altitude holding clearance with a relatively low minimum holding speed combined with turbulent air. The root of the perceived altitude deviation was the lack of clear communication with air traffic control, most likely due to the static interference from the nearby storms.","36000, 37000, 38000","38000","38000",TRUE
"83","Cruising on Autopilot (AP) at 9,000 direct ZZZ1 about 30 nm southwest of the VOR, I asked ATC for a deviation to the right to avoid an area of heavier precipitation, which they called out to me and I could see on my [GPS weather display].  Once clear of that heaviest area, I turned back north direct ZZZ1, and from ZZZ1 turned direct ZZZ2.  I had been in and out of the bottom of the ceiling at 9,000 MSL, no ice and mostly smooth.   Near ZZZ1 I started to encounter a lot more turbulence and entered solid IMC, in snow and clouds but still no icing.  I was keeping an eye outside to watch in case I needed to ask for lower if evidence of icing began.  ATC called and asked me to maintain 9,000 and repeated the altimeter setting, and I scanned and saw that I was descending through 8,600 MSL, and that the AP had turned off, probably due to the turbulence.  It does have an alarm when this happens but I did not hear it.  At that point I raised the nose to climb back to 9,000, but when I looked over at the Airspeed Indicator (ASI), it was dropping rapidly below 80 knots.  Not wanting to stall in IMC, I lowered the nose substantially.  At this point my scan was uneven and not making sense. I have read a lot of accounts of pilots who are rapidly overcome in situations like this. At that point I decided that the safest course of action would be to continue to descend rapidly to what I knew was warm VMC below me.  I lowered my landing gear, started a rapid descent to around 4,000 MSL, where I broke out of the snow and clouds and could reorient myself.  ATC advised me of closest local airports and asked about assistance, I asked them to stand by.  Once I was back in control and everything was looking normal, I flew on for a while, and continued on to my destination at 7,000 MSL, which from that point would keep me in VMC.  ATC asked me about the nature of the problem and I told them that I lost my AP in IMC and had loss of control.It is clear in hindsight that the reason I was seeing the drop in the ASI was that the pitot was being plugged with ice or snow or water.  I should have had the pitot heat on but did not.  The rest of the instruments could have shown me that, if my scan had been good, but I was only intermittently scanning while the AP was flying in cruise.  While my reaction was certainly a way to stay safe, it may have been an overreaction.   However, I was tired after a long day and knew I was not at my best, and I wanted to get somewhere safe quickly.  I was far from any busy airspace, and [advising ATC] and descending did not cause a scramble to move other aircraft, as far as I know.","","9000","9000","9000",TRUE
"88","Before we departed, we knew we would need a new route, which we received then, we called the fuel truck over to give us more fuel for the new route. Up to 8000lbs I believe.  The new route had us going ZZZ (VOR).DIESL.MSCT4 into IAH. Once airborne, we needed to deviate around a low overhang from the line of thunderstorms to our east, which is why we needed a reroute. Made contact with center, and they immediately turned us north towards IRW.TORNN. DRLLR4 into IAH. We told them that might not be possible. We tried to negotiate our way back down South, but to no avail. The captain and I determined we had enough fuel to reach IRW plus extra to get us to an airport well east of the line of weather to refuel, and continue on to IAH. We leveled off at FL370 for about 20-30 mins or so. Entered IMC conditions and noticed condensation on the inside of the windshield. Frost formed on the unheated portions of the windshield. About a minute later, we noticed that my airspeed began to drop rapidly, all the way down to zero in a matter of seconds. No changes to the aircraft have been made. The TL's were still set for LRC, and our altitude never changed. The Captain got an amber IAS miscompare message on his PFD, and his airspeed indicator matched the standby airspeed indications. We recognized that pitot 2 has been blocked, most likely by ice. We ran the NAV/FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FAILURE (QRH) Quick Reference Handbook procedure and it guided us to select the ADC reversion button on my reversionary panel. By the time I pushed the button the captain noticed an amber ALT miscompare on his PFD as well, and we noticed my altimeter was about 200 ft high. The same QRH procedure applies to this new message. I pressed the ADC reversion and I am now receiving cross side data for the captain's ADC. The QRH also tells us we are unable RVSM. We notified ATC, and we requested to stay at FL370 for as long as possible for fuel. It took them about 10 mins to get back to us on that answer, but in the meantime, we stayed at FL370 and we realized if we can stay at FL370 we can make it all the way into IAH without a fuel stop. We had a good tailwind that zipped us up to IRW. ATC let us stay at FL370 until we made the turn toward the south.  Once we made the turn southbound, ATC was giving us a series of radar vectors for sequencing into IAH, we declared min fuel, and they instructed us to descend to FL280. We were still up by IRW, so we knew descending to FL280 would significantly increase our fuel burn, so we decide to divert to ZZZ1. After lots of coordination between us and the dispatcher had called ahead to ZZZ1 and told them of our diversion, we amended the release and off we went. On our way to ZZZ1 in IMC we encountered some turbulence, and it kicked the autopilot off. Once we exited the turbulence the autopilot worked without issue. On the descent passing through 280-250 I decided to check and see if my pitot tube was still blocked. At this point we were in VMC conditions and still below freezing, but my airspeed and altitude were back to normal, and were matching up with the stand by and pitot 1 perfectly. So I at this point never re-selected the ADC reversion button again.  Once we landed in ZZZ1, we got more fuel and no passengers deplaned during the process. We were on the ground for less than 20 mins, before we departed to IAH without any issues.Once we landed in Houston, we did not write up the Pitot/static 2 blockage, because the issue resolved itself before landing. I do want to emphasize the ADC failure was not the primary reason for diverting. Even if we had stayed up at FL370, the delayed vectors and sequencing by ATC used up too much fuel and we would have diverted anyway without the ADC failing. Also we did not write it up because it wasn't a conventional failure of the ADC because we did not get any red 'X's' over the airspeed and altitude tapes. Looking back on it now, we should have written up the pitot/static 2 blockage so maintenance can track the issue so they can determine if this is a significant problem on the EMB-145 fleet, and or this particular aircraft. Overall I think us as a crew handled the situation very well. The captain and I had a shared mental model the whole flight. Our communication was spot on, and we effectively managed the threats as to not cause an UAS.  The Flight attendant did an outstanding job keeping the passengers calm, and the coordination with our dispatcher was text book! The reason for my extended duty time was that I had about 6 hours of rest then had to teach a class at the training center. Which counts as FDP if I was going to fly later, which I didn't, because I would have had at least 10 hours after my training event. There were many threats associated with this flight. There was the line of severe weather along our route of flight, it was the last leg of a four day trip for the CA and FA, and just the last leg of a day trip for me. The sun was setting.  On the ground ATC reroute and an airborne ATC reroute. IMC conditions at high altitudes. Landing in ZZZ1, the tower was closed, and it had a shorter runway. We were able to use effective threat and error management to manage the threats associated with this flight, under abnormal circumstances so we never got into an UAS. I would definitely have made sure that we wrote up the pitot/static blockage, so that it can be tracked in our maintenance program.  On the ground [at our departure airport] I could have been more proactive and asked ATC if there were any problems with our filed route, so that we could have put more fuel on board, and avoided a diversion. I hope the company can use the data on the pitot/static 2 blockage to see if it is a recurring problem on our aircraft type, or this particular airplane.","","200, 280, 28000, 37000","37000","37000",TRUE

Shortly after this radio communication, I found myself within the west approach corridor of MIA. I did not request clearance from Miami Approach for the following reasons: the tower (which on the Miami sectional appears to be in bravo airspace) had given me a vector and altitude, had not suggested that any further clearance was required.

"115","While conducting the HYDRR1 RNAV Arrival into PHX in a B737, we were directed by ATC to keep our speed at 300 knots until GEELA, and then comply with speeds at GEELA. We complied with this, and as we approached GEELA we were given a speed reduction, which we complied with.  At .3 DME prior to CHAVO with the aircraft in LNAV/VNAV PATH, the aircraft was leveling at 9000 feet at 210 knots as depicted on the arrival.  It was mid-afternoon in PHX with temperature in the low 100s and occasional moderate turbulence.  At this point I received a VNAV disconnect message, which I cleared.  In the few seconds it took to assess what the aircraft was doing, and reengage a mode on the MCP, the aircraft may have crossed CHAVO up to 200 feet low since I had the bottom altitude of 7000 feet in the Altitude window while the airplane was VNAV PATH.  I had applied a little power while determining whether I needed to level or continue descent.  Now, (maybe five seconds after the disconnect) we were past CHAVO. I decided to idle the power, dial 1000 FPM into Vertical Speed and continue the descent to comply with LEMOE at 7000 feet.  With the turbulence and the disconnect, the speed had accelerated to near 230 knots.  I deployed speed boards to slow the aircraft back to 210 knots while continuing to comply with the LEMOE crossing restriction.","We were descending on the HYDRR 1 RNAV Arrival, Runway 25L transition, into PHX. We just received the new ATIS, which included a windshear advisory. The arrival was normal until AGGLA, with LNAV and VNAV PATH engaged. As we were approaching CHAVO, 210 knots/9000 FT, the FO had to deploy the speedbrakes as the airspeed was increasing. Simultaneously, we encountered moderate chop. The Controller asked us what the winds were, and I reported they were 350/10. At that moment, I think the VNAV PATH disconnected. It appeared the aircraft was not going to level at 9000 FT because the Vertical Speed was also increasing! The FO immediately tried to level the aircraft and arrest the increasing speed, but I believe we went below 9000 FT at CHAVO. Our maximum airspeed through the event was 220 knots. We were back in VNAV PATH after CHAVO, and the rest of the arrival and landing were uneventful. The FO thought we made the CHAVO restriction, but I'm not so sure. There were no other aircraft involved, and the Controller did not say anything else to us.Although I don't think this was a full-blown windshear event, I suspect a combination of the shifting tailwind and turbulence drove the VNAV to disconnect. Also, the thrust levers were at idle, and the speedbrakes were deployed throughout. Therefore, I don't think the FO could have done much more to slow down. Finally, I think the FO did a good job of recognizing this dynamic event, and responding about as quickly as he could.Although I don't think the FPA went to VNAV SPD, an additional signal to alert us when the FPA comes out of PATH, or switches to SPD, would be very helpful. I'm sure many other Pilots would agree.","200, 7000, 9000","9000","9000",TRUE

"124","This flight was conducted in accordance with part 91 of the FAR. The aircraft was flown by myself and was on a long cross-country flight to Stella Maris Bahamas, conducted during daylight and in VFR conditions. The flight conditions had started to degrade during the flight sometime after a refuel stop, in Northern Florida. As many thunderstorms popped up enroute, I had to make may course changes to avoid IMC and thunderstorms, with onboard weather (XM) I was able to make tactical choices to head East and clear through the East Coast where the thunderstorm activity was significantly less. I had contacted Jacksonville Center for advisories enroute and as I was near Titusville, FL the ATC controller told me to turn South heading, I reaffirmed that I was not able to travel any further South as there was a level 4 thunderstorm within five miles of my position. At this point, there were few options, she stated I could climb or descend but none were on option as I was above class B airspace at 11,500 MSL and was not cleared and could have been in IMC if I had complied with instructions, my fault was that I did not see the restricted airspace to the East, R2934 and R2935 for the NASA launch facility. The weather constraints and issues with ATC, fighting them to keep them from sending me into a thunderstorm pushed me further South and into the restricted airspace. I penetrated the far North end of R2934 and R2935 in order to continue my flight but did not realize it until I was already half way through. At this point, the only option I had open for me was the restricted airspace. Knowing that NASA does not launch during IMC and coastal thunderstorms, I felt there were no actual conflicts with NASA at the time. I nor fully believe that when I travel in the summer through Florida, I should get a much earlier start before the summer pop-up thunderstorms cause me problems. I believe ATC should understand that unable means unable when dealing with severe weather conditions and give GA aircraft under VFR the same consideration that the airlines get.","","11500","11500","11500",TRUE
"126","We were filed for the arrival into ZZZ, during cruise flight, we were unable to get to FL330 due to performance of the aircraft, so we requested FL290 for the final. We put the altitude and changes into the FMS and ACARS ECON speed. It showed our fuel more than adequate for FL290 with initial routing. Prior to ZZZ VOR we requested direct to ZZZ1 VOR, which was approved and flown. During our routing we were given a reroute. We were also given a [second] additional reroute.I do not recall exactly when, but I believe after the 2nd reroute we were given I believe a 180 degree heading away/south of course and slowed. This off route vector lasted approximately +30 minutes. We had additional off route vectors, if I recall, 180 heading, 090, then another northwest turn, etc.We asked the Controller how much longer on the headings, as we would be slim on fuel if we were taken further away from our destination/routing. He said not much longer - we were told by controllers that it would be only a few minutes. We were then given deviations back towards our route and the Controller stated that they are going to need more spacing, as he didn't give them enough. Once on the arrival our fuel continued to reduce. We sent an ACARS to dispatch asking current weather and another airport of their choice. We told them the situation of considering possible divert but we are continuing at this point.When our fuel continued to [be] reduced, we were considering [alternate airports]. However, at this point these airports were equal distance from each other and [one] was behind us. With all the consideration and factors we continued [to the destination]. With our estimated fuel on arrival continuing to be reduced, we elected to declare MIN FUEL to the Controller and Dispatcher, planning [visual approach]. At that point we were landing with approximately 1.6 fuel and planning the [visual approach to XY] (as our previous flights were and it was a non-event / no delays). We were given descend via [a second arrival]. Once on approach we informed them also that we were min fuel.At this point we were task saturated. Approach informed us that we will be doing the LDA XY with a +12 mile final, which was different than expected from the Visual XY of less than a 6 mile final. When we inserted the LDA Z XY into the FMS, it showed our estimated fuel on arrival at being 850 lbs. At that point, we immediately decided to [advise ATC we were minimum fuel] due to the inability to complete the entire LDA XY approach. Once [we advised ATC of our fuel state], ATC immediately turned us to the right and said go direct to ZZZZZ Intersection I believe (which was on LDA Y XY). LDA Y XY is not in the FMS and we said we needed Z.There was confusion with ATC with our inability for Y vs. Z, as we were all task saturated at that point. He said unable Z, and asked if we had the [landmark]. We were in and out of IMC/VMC. At that point we crossed the inbound course to LDA XY / north side of the [landmark]. I do not believe we penetrated [restricted airspace] but there is a chance that it did happen, but I do not believe we did. Controller advised 220 degree heading while we were in IMC, which was complied with.CA came on the radio really quickly and asked what is ATC's plan if we don't get the [landmark in sight]. A few seconds later we had visual on the [landmark] and FO (First Officer) called in sight, which was off our right. At that point, we were cleared Visual XY. Once we were taken off the arrival and immediately turned in for the visual, our fuel became min fuel status.We flew the Visual to XY and advised to contact Tower. On contact with Tower, ATC asked if we preferred XZ. We declined XZ, as the CA personally has never landed or taken off from XZ, and we had numbers for XY. It was the best course of action to continue with the original plan of XY so it did not make the situation more complex. Cleared to land XY. Landed on XY, and clearedat Taxiway D I believe.

Upon arrival at the gate, we had approximately 1.5/1.6 FOB (Fuel on Board).The [admission of low fuel to ATC] was necessary and the safest course of action due to the expected approach, etc. However, since we were taken off the arrival and not the long final, it enabled our fuel at gate to remain approximately 1.5/1.6. Upon arrival, CA called TRACON to discuss the confusion with Y/Z as they wanted to know where the confusion happened. CA informed them we were unable to accept direct ZZZZZ Intersection due to FMS limitations and the last minute changes and task saturations. He said something along the lines of understanding that [company] has issues with Y, etc.","In my humble opinion, I believe the event could have been avoided. It's not uncommon to receive extended vectors or numerous reroutes going in to ZZZ or any other high traffic volume airport. In this case, our flight was twenty-three minutes over planned block time and the majority of that time was spent flying ATC assigned headings. We were given minimum RESERVE fuel, zero ALT or HOLD fuel and only TANKER 697 lbs. If our flight was adequately fueled beyond the absolute minimum levels, I do not believe this event would have occurred. It seems to be extremely common that crews are only given MIN fuel for flights, with no contingency fuel added.

When it happened this time, we intervened, and manually arrested the impending altitude deviation, but just barely. The failure is subtle because the aircraft first appears to begin a level off approaching 9000 FT. Then it smoothly pitches over prior to CHAVO and leaves little time to intervene. I also believe it's happening to other Pilots because it is such a subtle failure, you might not see it unless watching very closely. A jumpseat Pilot who was with us said he never saw anything like it.Be prepared to quickly intervene prior to CHAVO, or an altitude deviation will likely occur.

We asked the Approach Controller for vectors to the localizer to prevent flying into the weather that was showing on the aircraft radar. The FO (First Officer) had the radar up on the MFD (Multifunction Display), while the terrain was in the captain's side MFD. The Controller said that there was no radar contact as well as WX radar capability for the airport terminal area as well as him continuously asking us 'what's your position?'. We started the approach from 15,000 feet past CONDE intersection, I told the FO we need to get down to ten thousand feet (which is depicted on the approach plate) to better set up for the approach without being high and unstable. He replied that the night prior at the same airport, he (FO PF), started down early and had a terrain caution. I explained to him, if you are on the published segment of the approach and complying with the altitude restrictions, there should be no problem with any terrain cautions. We started the arc and as we briefed earlier, that was to cut the corner of the WX to intercept the localizer and shoot the ILS approach, we agreed and went as planned.

After engaging the auto pilot, I had to assist the FO to initiating a climb to 15,000 (now being unprotected and in terrain environment). I told the Controller that we had to miss and if there is a way (due to position SE of the field), can we do the ILS DME 1 runway 14. The Controller approved the request and I briefed to the FO to switch to VOR frequency and track the 348 radial outbound to 8 DME to intercept the localizer for the runway. During the maneuvering I briefed the approach and mentioned to the FO he needed to position himself better so as to be out of the cone of confusing for a proper setup of the course. The FO started to turn towards the VOR and asked if I wanted to fly it. I asked him, 'Do you feel like you can handle this?', he said yes. Noticing that we were not going to successfully shoot the ILS DME 1 runway 14, I asked the Controller can we proceed to CONDE intersection and rejoin the arc for the ILS DME 2 runway 14. This is after a quick calculation of fuel to know that we had time to try one more attempt till proceeding to the alternate, QRO. The Controller approved the request and we vectored ourselves back to CONDE intersection. While setting up for the approach, the stick shaker came 'on' for a second. The airspeed indicated approximately 175 Knots. While observing the airspeed the stick shaker again came 'on'. I immediately positioned both trust levers to MAX CON and questioned the FO as to what he was doing. The FO replied that he was watching me. I instructed the FO to return the aircraft to 200 Knots and maintain normal flight conditions. Upon returning to normal flight conditions I completed the approach setup and again briefed the FO on the approach. We then successfully intercepted the course inbound on the arc. I transferred the FCC (Flight Control Computer) to the CA side and told the FO to go green, and, tune and identify the localizer on his side while the autopilot flew the arc in white needles on the Captain's FCC. When on the altitudes published and established on the arc, the FO went to HDG mode to intercept the localizer as agreed to during the briefing. The FCP (Flight Computer Plan) on the CA side must have still been in the NAV mode because when I was going green just before the intercept point, which we agreed upon, the FMA went to ROLL mode before transferring back to the FOs FCC card so as to go to APP mode. The FO never caught the ROLL mode on the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciation). I asked him just before the localizer started coming alive, 'why are you in ROLL mode?'. He replied, 'I don't know.' I then told him to arm the approach, the aircraft once again started to fly past the localizer while the approach mode was trying to correct for the localizer and current winds. That's when the FO disengaged the auto pilot and put the aircraft in a bank to try and re-intercept the localizer, which triggered the EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System) 'BANK ANGLE'. I immediately took the controls while I monitored the bank passing 45 degrees to reaching approx 70 degrees and said 'my aircraft'. We were able to re-intercept the ILS due to close proximity of the course with the autopilot re-engaged and fully configured just before G/S intercept. When we broke out, there were four whites to three whites one red and landed the aircraft without further issues. Recommendations would be, training in the simulator for all pilots on the procedures for DME arcs and non-radar environment during AQP (Advanced Qualification Program) as a refresher. This is due to the fact of consistently being in radar contact from airport to airport in the USA, that the use of non-radar environment procedures diminishes through time with lack of use. Also, understanding that there is mountainous terrain in the cities we go to in Mexico, there needs to be at least a better radar system for aircraft vectoring as well as WX avoidance on the ground to preclude an issues with arriving in these airports. Looking back on this now, one, I should have proceeded to the hold on the MAP and tried to wait out the WX (fuel permitting) and two, I should have taken control of the aircraft the moment this first started (the first time overflying the localizer). From that day on, I have flown every leg into Mexico due to the nature of the flight environment and experience level of the FOs I have flown with.","","15000","15000","15000",TRUE
"134","I was approaching the Fairbanks (FAI) TRSA from the east on a Heading of 090 degrees (I was about 25 miles from FAI airport). After being handed off from Anchorage Center to Fairbanks Approach, I contacted Fairbanks approach and checked on with my call sign and altitude and I that I had received the ATIS information for Ladd Army Airfield. I advised Fairbanks Approach that I would be requesting a Visual approach to Ladd Army Air Field. I requested a lower altitude was given a clearance to descend to 4,000 Ft (may have actually been 4,300 ft.). When I arrived at the assigned altitude my forward visibility was estimated at 4 to 5 miles at my current altitude. However my visibility was somewhat obscured due to the moderate rain shower I was flying through. My forward visibility was also reduced by the rain hitting my windshield. I was subsequently advised by Fairbanks approach that I had same direction traffic. A VFR Cessna, 3 miles at my 12 o'clock position. I noticed on my TCAS screen confirmed the traffic. I asked if the traffic was for Ladd Army Airfield. The controller confirmed this. Shortly after receiving the confirmation, the Cessna dropped off my TCAS screen. I decided to cancel IFR and requested traffic advisories to Ladd Field. After a minute of two I was handed off to Ladd Tower. I thought it odd because the Ladd Tower had closed. I remembered thinking the controller meant to contact Ladd Tower Frequency for Common traffic advisories. I switched to 125.0 (Ladd tower frequency) I heard the Cessna entering the Ladd traffic pattern for RW 25R at about the same time I believed I had the Ladd Airfield in sight and I advised the Cessna of my position. The Cessna indicated that he would follow me for 25R so I elected to make a short approach to runway 25R. As I touched down on the Runway I became aware that I was not at Ladd field. I was horrified as I realized I landed at Fairbanks International (FAI) runway 20R. I had been on the Ladd advisory frequency advising a Cessna at a different airport about 6 miles away!!!I exited the runway at the first taxiway intersection that I could safely exit. I contacted Fairbanks Ground. I was given a phone number to call. Had I not spent so much time looking for traffic I would have noticed that I was still 6 miles from Ladd. If I would have not cancelled IFR I would have been advised distance to Ladd Field Had the Ladd Tower been open they would have advised me of my position. Mitigating circumstances:1. Visibility restricted by moderate rain shower. I could see the FAI airport at 3-4 miles however the airfield was blurred due to the rain on my windshield. The terrain and airport for Ladd Army Airfield looks very similar under the current conditions.2. The controller appeared to me to have handed me off to Ladd Field Tower (advisories) earlier than I had previous flights into the area (I assumed I was closer to Ladd Field).3. My previous experience in flying into Ladd field was just over two days. I was not as familiar with the area as I thought I was. 4. I was more concerned about traffic in front of me than monitoring my distance to Ladd field.5. The class C airspace for FAI and FBK are joined together. So when I was instructed to call the tower it may be that that tower was meant to be Fairbanks Tower. If the controller slipped and just said 'contact the tower' or 'contact Ladd tower' or 'Fairbanks tower;' even if the tower specified was not clear; it just seems to me that the controller should cite the frequency I.E. contact Ladd Tower 125.0 or Fairbanks tower 118.3. Especially when 2 Class C airspace airports are joined with common airport traffic area boundary. The addition to the controller giving frequency after the name of the tower should make it less likely for pilots to switch to the wrong tower frequency.What changes I made since this incident:I will no longer fly into a busy airport environment under VFR flight rules. I will always stayon my IFR flight plan until after either and instrument approach or a visual approach has resulted in landing at the airport of intended landing. I believe that by cancelling IFR while still in the air, I accepted all responsibility for navigation and traffic separation, dismissing the controllers that were there to help me. In the future I will spend more time familiarizing myself with the arrival areas of airports I am not as familiar with.","","4000, 4300","4000","4000",TRUE
"146","After arriving at our cruising altitude we received our first reroute from Toronto center on at FL360. This clearance was only a partial clearance, and I did not accept it due to it not being a complete clearance. I told the controller we needed a complete clearance or he needed to give us a holding clearance. After that he responded with, 'you can't take (EFC) clearances', 'expect the rest of the clearance from the next guy', 'Ive never heard of that'. The clearance he gave us was from YQO to VHP with no other fix. I told him we needed a complete full route clearance so we know what to do in case of lost communications. He then issued us YQO, VHP, direct ORD.  That situation seemed to solve itself by us not accepting the partial clearance.  We then received two more re-routes to ORD and ended up holding over WEEVR intersection. Prior to hitting our BINGO fuel we were further given a clearance of direct VHP SPI PNT TRTLL2 ORD. This clearance was unacceptable as we didn't anywhere close to the amount of fuel needed to accept the route. As this is all happening the dispatcher is communicating the position of the weather very well to us using familiar fix's on ORD arrivals as well as where new cells were 'blowing up'...this was incredibly helpful as the weather review the First Officer and I had done prior to this flight as well as the vantage point we had during the hold which allowed us to scan what seemed like the entire upper Midwest with our aircraft's radar showed that the storms where building in front of the strong cold front.  During all of this discussion the release was amended to show MKE as our new alternate. This was a very good choice as at that time MKE was behind the line of weather and the cold front was almost completely moved through the area. Further discussion between myself and the First Officer was that should a diversion happen we decided to only go to any airport that would allow us to descend behind the line of weather (on the west side), and also be west of the front. We agreed and planned for a diversion to MKE. This decision was also communicated to dispatch. Our dispatcher was very helpful during this phase of the flight, providing very timely communication about the weather and responding to a lot of ACARS text messages. After requesting ATC to see if they could further cut our route, they stuck to the (VHP SPI PNT TRTLL2 ORD) route. I then notified ATC we would be changing our destination to MKE. ATC then responded very quickly to question this choice. ATC suggested IND, and CVG. Although those airports were somewhat geographically closer, they were on the wrong side of the front, line of thunderstorms, and not what this crew (including dispatch) had planned for. At this point we are now getting to a situation where we will not be able to land in MKE with 45 mins of fuel. Due to this as well as what seems like ATC's inability to address our fuel concern; I elected to declare [minimum] fuel, and stated we would need to head to MKE.While en route to MKE, ATC asked us if we would be able to accept going to ORD. I said we would but we would need priority to land, and no further delays. We then amended the release again via ACARS to show ORD as our destination. It then seemed as though ATC wanted us to cancel our status. They asked us twice for this, and were very unusual requests. Due to our fuel level at the time of those requests we would not have been able to attempt a landing in ORD, go missed, then attempt a landing in MKE, go missed, and still have anything close to 45 mins of fuel with the weather and amount of traffic going into ORD and MKE at that time.  I made it clear were not going to cancel our status and we continued to fly a visual approach to runway 28C, with a normal landing. We landed with 2700lbs of fuel.","","36000","36000","36000",TRUE
"151","While at cruise at FL380, ATC informed us to 'turn right 30 degrees, immediately.'  As I confirmed the clearance, the First Officer (Pilot Flying) started the right turn.  While commencing the turn, I saw a co-altitude TCAS target (opposite direction traffic) at approximately the 10-11 o'clock position about 7-8 miles away and closing.  This was followed by a Traffic Alert (traffic, traffic), which was almost immediately followed by a Resolution Advisory (Climb, Climb). The autopilot was immediately disconnected and a TCAS climb initiated.  We climbed approximately 300-400 feet before we were advised 'Clear of Conflict,' and descended back to FL380.After the event, Maastricht Control offered an explanation.  He stated that the conflicting traffic had been on a different frequency and answered someone else's radio call to begin a descent. The conflicting aircraft erroneously started a descent to/through our altitude.   Listening more attentively to ATC when given new altitude clearance. (conflicting A/C)  Had ATC recognized the descending Aircraft earlier perhaps an earlier heading correction for us could have prevented the RA.  Everything happened in an extremely compressed period of time (approximately 30 seconds).  Had we not followed ATC and TCAS instructions immediately the outcome could have been much different","","300, 400, 38000","38000","38000",TRUE

"153","We were on the base to final for ILS Runway 22 at LGA, ATC gave us clearance to turn on heading 250, descend to 2,000 feet and cleared for ILS Approach Runway 22, I turned on heading, descended to 2,000 feet in FLCH and armed approach ( LOC,GS were armed). Localizer moved and was captured on FMA around 7-8 DME and GS was alive, when LOC needle was less than 1 dot, the airplane suddenly roll wings level with increasing descent. The distance to the runway was around 6-7 miles. I checked FMA, it was in ROLL and Flight Path Angle (FPA) mode. I disconnected autopilot making correction to bring back the airplane on the correct flight path.I distrust the automation at this time and continued approach in the manual mode, monitoring raw data indication and VASI on the Runway 22. During the maneuver, I went slightly lower on the glide path and received twice EGPWS glideslope alert. I corrected glide path and landed uneventfully.My First Officer told me after landing that he experienced and observed 3 cases of these anomalies over the last several months and it was ILS approach Runway 22 and distance when anomalies occurred from 6 to 10 miles on final. I suggested him to submit a report about the anomalies too. I did not find any NOTAMs regarding these anomalies and ATC did not notify us about deviation.I could only suspect false LOC and GS or interference with ILS signals. The airplane equipment worked correctly on the next approach. The high workload and task saturation to correct the flight path after anomalies distracted me from monitoring the glide path.","","2000","2000","2000",TRUE
"154","I had taken off from KMMU. Prior to takeoff, I had informed Morristown Ground of my request: Take off MMU, proceed to EWR direct, transition Class B airspace to the Statue of Liberty, remain in the Class B up the Hudson River. I have performed this routing at least 4 times prior to this instance without incident. Morristown Tower handed me off to Newark Tower. I believe at that point EWR Tower told me to remain clear of the New York Class B. My altitude was 1,500 feet MSL, and I had adjusted to EWR's Altimeter Setting. I was approximately 7 NM out on a 270 radial from the EWR tower, essentially perpendicular to the main runway alignment. I was given a Bravo clearance and told to aim for the EWR Tower. From this point on, I would usually be given Vectors to overfly the approach end of the Runway in use and proceed towards the Statue (this is located midfield). However, this is where this occurrence deviated from what I was used to. I was told to proceed South at approximately 3 NM out, now parallel to the main Runway alignment. When I was abeam the Runway 4 numbers, the Tower instructed me to 'Proceed on Course, overfly the 22 Numbers and remain South of the Newark ATC Tower. This has been my first flight in 60 day, so while not overwhelmed, I was still 'knocking the rust off a bit'. This airspace is complex, but having done this flight multiple times previously, I had no reason to think this was too much to handle. So when I heard this instruction, my mind interpolated this information; I was already abeam the Runway 4 numbers, and the instruction was to 'remain South of the Newark tower'. I interpreted, based on where the Controller had me fly to and the instruction 'stay south of the tower' that I was on the correct flight path. Further, there was no other Local traffic other than arrivals and departures to the field, so I figured there was no reason for ATC to have me divert this far south just to fly north again. Based on this, I set up to cross over what I had assumed was the RWY 22 numbers but was actually the RWY 4 numbers. At 1 NM out on this path, the controller of course instructed me to turn Left and reiterated I was to fly over the 22 Numbers. At the same moment, I began to have some squelch issues with my headset. In this time, the controller turned me back to the North (180 turn) and I then became reoriented and realized what exactly he wanted me to do. I flew north past the tower and began to turn to cross over the RWY 22 number. I had the numbers visually and aligned toward them, but the controller said, 'You have to fly by my rules if you want to use my airspace, sir'. I was perplexed and now disoriented because I had to unscramble his instruction, and then when I finally did, he still corrected me. He told me to run back out to the west of the field and we would try this again. He instructed me to remain 'At or Below 1500' which I thought was an odd request considering there was a heavy commercial traffic arriving and departing the field. There was some moderate chop, so I decided to stay at 1,300 as to give myself some room in case I hit some updrafts in order to respect his altitude instruction. Again, I was now reoriented to cross the RWY 22 number, he cleared me to do so. Overhead the field, he told me that my altitude indicated 1,200 and that if I wanted to fly in his airspace I need to learn how to keep Altitude. I responded with a compliant, 'yes sir' so as to not trigger any spiteful action like rerouting or even investigation, as I felt that wasn't too far away. Just before I was handed off to LGA tower, I heard a similar incident transpire in which this controller was having an interpersonal issue with what I believe was a helo doing some photo work. This controller was disorientingly unclear in his instruction which he followed up with curt ambiguous reprimand. I have never had this problem before and have performed this same route at various time of day with various traffic flow and have never experienced this. I couldn't help but feel that the routing to the south of the field only to proceed North again then make a 35 degree bank to shoot his desired track of between Runway 11-29 and the tower was just an action to discourage VFR traffic and make it known I was not welcome. I am fully aware that Transition service and overflight are provided on a workload permitting basis, so just turn me away instead of posing obstacles meant to give me a bad experience. Having said that, I should have inquired further and double checked the runways to ensure what the controller said was accurate. Even if I felt like I was an intrusion, I should have taken the time to verify all facts with an ambiguous request. From now on, I will always double check a controller's instructions and make sure they are coherent. Trust, but verify.","","1500","1500","1500",TRUE

We advised Air Traffic Control that following 'BTOGA' there were storm cells over 'HILEY and KAINS' intersections and that we wanted to deviate to the west. ATC advised that that was not possible due to departure flow leaving the Miami airports.At his time ATC advised us that we were to expect the LOC 8L approach instead of the ILS 12 approach that we had preloaded into the aircraft's navigation system. With this new runway assignment, the aircraft's navigation system was reprogrammed and we briefed the approach procedures.As we finished loading and briefing the new runway, we advised that we needed to deviate from course as the storms were in our way.Initially, ATC had us flying between the build ups, and then gave us a speed restriction of 210 Knots and a descent of 11,000 to 8,000 feet. While trying to slow the aircraft down and descending, I was using the spoilers and with the VLS speed approaching our aircrafts speed, I called for Flaps 1.ATC assigned a southerly heading that would have us fly into the face of a storm, so the Captain called for an immediate autopilot off, right turn. (Of note here is that this was becoming a rough bouncy ride due to the storms that we were approaching.) I complied and made mistake of lowering the nose while turning. This resulted in a rapid acceleration of the airspeed that I failed to notice as I was visually trying to avoid the worse of the storm. At this time the aircraft's audio over speed horn sounded and the airspeed had increased to approximately 265 knots. At this time, I immediately leveled the aircraft and slowed to below flap extension speed.After arrival at the airport gate, Maintenance was notified, and the flap over speed event was documented in the maintenance log.Additionally on this LOC 8L approach, I executed a go around as I was too high and fast to be established and stable for the landing.

By the time it goes through its warm-up cycle the airplane may have traveled 10 miles.ATC vectored us into an embedded cumulus cell, telling us there was an area of heavy precipitation at our 12 o'clock. When the Q400 radar was available it showed us only four miles from a level three cell. Radio congestion delayed our clearance for a left turn. It was necessary to revert to level one automation to increase our turn rate. During this high workload activity FO set the altitude alerter to 14,000. Climbing through about 10,900 ATC queried our altitude assignment. FO thought it was 14,000, Center said it was 10,000 and cleared us to 11,000.CA was flying. It was a 12 hour day following an FAR 117 minimum rest.","","10900","10900","10900",TRUE
"183","During our arrival into the Southern California area on the KAYOH 5 arrival we were assigned to deviate off the arrival for weather.  We were then assigned to cross a fix at so many miles at an altitude assigned by ATC. (I don't want to list what the specific fix and altitude were because I cannot remember with 100% accuracy due to the time between knowledge of possible deviation and actual occurrence). Due to the aircraft's previous Bleed 2 failures that had been occurring during decent to low altitudes, (and had been written up on a previous leg) I missed the initial PNF ATC clearance readback while I was monitoring the aircrafts systems. (The aircraft was subsequently written upon our arrival to SNA for just that problem and a full CMC download was required). I then asked the PNF what the instructions were and told him I had missed them because I had been checking the synoptic page, He told me and I set the Altitude the PNF heard, and repeated to me, into the [flight computer], I then set the crossing restriction into the flight plan's ATK feature and initiated a VNAV descent via the autopilot. That controller then handed us off to the next controller. During the check on with the new controller I heard the PNF read back the altitude we had set in the [flight computer] and the crossing restriction and heard NO correction from that controller.During the descent it became apparent to me that due to the terrain and geography of the area, the assigned altitude seemed excessively low, and the situation raised a red flag in my head. As a precaution I immediately initiated a level off and began a climb while simultaneously asking the PNF to verify that the assigned altitude was correct for this area.  The controller told us 'negative' and to climb and maintain 13,000 ft.  Which we immediately did. At no time did the controller tell us we were below our assigned altitude nor did they issue any other warnings. It was only by PIC action that a correction took place. I took the comms to query ATC as to what had happened and the controlled seemed completely unsure. I believe he asked what we had been assigned and said he would check with the previous controller. When he finally came back to us he simply proceeded to hand us off to the next controller, but before switching off I asked him if this was something I needed to worry about, (a pilot deviation) or if I could be expecting a phone number? He said No, and I took that to mean that the error had been on ATCs end and would we not need to protect ourselves with a NASA report.  At no time were we ever told we had deviated from an assigned altitude or clearance, and because the controller told us we shouldn't need to worry about a deviation, neither myself nor my co-pilot filled out a NASA report. It is due to that reason why neither of us can recollect with 100% accuracy, (on our end) what altitudes were involved. The time between the incident and time we were made aware of a possible deviation made that impossible. We do recall during the initial check on/read-back with that final controller, that the altitude and clearance was what we had in put into the FMS and AFCS respectively.I believe my first error in this event took place when I allowed myself to become distracted by the aircrafts previous CAS messages during low altitude operations and while monitoring the systems in an attempt to diagnose them, I missed the Initial ATC instructions. The other error was not asking the PNF to reconfirm the initial clearance with ATC since I had not heard it directly.  I will now be more vigilant in both areas and also will fill out a NASA form even if I am led to believe, or do not believe a deviation or safety issued but could still be possible.","","13000","13000","13000",TRUE
"185","Restricted Area Special Use AirspaceRestricted Area was active 30,000 feet and below.Weather event day for ZHU and ZFW.  Weather from DFW to SAT.  DFW SE corner post was closed due to weather.  Traffic Management Unit (TMU) play books in effect for DFW and DAL.  Restricted Area is located just north of GRK and has hot artillery shells fired in airspace.  At approximately XA:00 local time, controllers advised supervisors that said restricted area was a safety factor for deviating aircraft.  It is my belief that several aircraft deviated Restricted Area while live artillery was in use. Throughout the day Rocksprings and Austin area supervisors attempted multiple times to lower restricted area after controller requests.  Forth Worth Center supervisors also made attempts to lower restricted area. Each request to lower it was denied by Supervisor Traffic Management Unit (TMU). The S TMU's response was that all Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI's) had to be exhausted before the restricted area was lowered.  They stated that TMIs will keep all aircraft clear of restricted area. Pull the weather data all day for Stonewall and Kelly sectors, Bergstrom sector, Austin sector, Junction sector, Hicoe sector, and Dallas sector.  Any TMI issued to miss restricted area accomplishes absolutely nothing due to convective activity.  The NEXRAD data shows these sectors were saturated with convective activity.  Convective activity is extremely dynamic and it is impossible for controllers to predict exactly how aircraft will deviate.  NEXRAD data lags behind, therefore, not showing the exact location of precipitation.  NEXRAD does not show overhangs, turbulence, and thrown hail from thunderstorms.  Keep in mind the turbulence from convective activity is responsible for loss of aircraft control and the majority of injuries and deaths related to thunderstorms.  As an ex airline pilot that has deviated around thunderstorms, I can assure you that pilots deviate well beyond displayable precipitation to avoid turbulence.  Therefore it is impossible to tie aircraft down on exact routes with convective activity.  Simply put with the amount of convective activity in these sectors, issuing TMIs to avoid the restricted area is asinine.  This does not ensure aircraft will miss restricted area and may be forcing aircraft unnecessarily into a precarious situation.   The above pilot deviating knowledge was also discussed in recent crew briefings. A pilot did a crew briefing at ZHU regarding the dangers of build ups, turbulence and overhangs, all of which NEXRAD does not show.  He made very clear statements that aircraft deviate around airspace that may not actually show precipitation.  I do not understand how ZHU management passes these safety tools down to controllers but when controllers apply this knowledge on sector the Supervisory Traffic Management Coordinator (STMC) dismisses it.  The STMC, in reality, has no clue how aircraft will deviate around weather.  Let's now discuss other safety factors regarding the restricted area.  During recurrent training at ZHU we were taught the 'Swiss Cheese Model' for errors and accidents.  The model basically states that for aviation errors and accidents to occur, certain controller errors/distractions take place leading up to a potentially catastrophic event. Factors affecting sectors on this day are as follows:  -'red' sectors, extremely elevated map values-weather deviations-holding for Fort Worth Center-extremely time consuming re routes -frequency congestionRestricted Area: the controller shouldn't have had to deal with it.  The other issues were unavoidable; the restricted area could have been mitigated.  Given the above distractions, controllers made request for the restricted area to be lowered.  They were attempting to remove one of the holes in the 'Swiss Cheese Model' to avoid an error or accident. In conclusion, the STMU explained that all TMI's have to be exhausted to take back restricted area.  As stated above convective activity saturated sectors around the restricted area, there was no way for controllers to pin down aircraft to TMI's.  Therefore all TMI's were exhausted at this time.  The STMU's above statement is simply ignorant, unacceptable, and a threat to the integrity of the National Airspace (NAS).  The STMU's decision not to recall the restricted airspace put the NAS in grave danger.  Again, please keep in mind that during this time live artillery was fired in restricted area.  An individual with STMC responsibilities should be aware that aircraft do not stay established on TMIs when affected by convective activity.  Considering the above information it is disconcerting that this individual potentially jeopardized hundreds of lives.Requesting a Traffic Management Review for [this date occurrence]","I was working [the] Traffic Management Unit (TMU) position during a large weather event day. The convective weather was present in ZFW as well as ZHU. The CQY Area was shut down for DFW and DAL arrivals, a national playbook was in effect routing the traffic that normally flows through CQY around to the north to the BYP Area and around the south through ZHU to the JEN Area. Weather was also building to the south and west of DFW inside the JEN area throughout the shift. Arrivals were having difficulties deviating around the weather in the JEN Area. The DFW airport had been shut down for arrivals numerous times, a 1st Tier Ground Stop had been issued for DFW as well as an internal ZFW Ground Stop for DFW. The airport opened and shut down several times throughout the shift. The FLM's for both the DAL and JEN Areas requested numerous times that the Restricted Area be capped at a lower altitude than 30,000 feet, and the ZHU TMU concurred. Grey Approach Control and the [military] control the Restricted Area Airspace and refused every request to cap Restricted Area. Aircraft were holding in the JEN area for the DFW stop and the JEN area Front Line manager as well as the ZFW Operations Manager both concurred this was an unsafe situation as the holding aircraft were too close to the Restricted Area airspace. This event occurred over a 6-hour period of time and should not continue.This is the second time in less than a year that Grey Approach Control and the [military] have refused to lower the cap of Restricted Area when asked for safety reasons. An aircraft deviating into Restricted Areas in a weather event is a very distinct possibility.ZHU or ZFW TMU and Operations Managers should have more say when a weather event occurs to ensure the safe and expeditious flow of traffic around the area. The Letter Of Agreement controlling the Restricted Area needs to be amended to give the option to ZFW and ZHU to cap the Restricted Area in a reasonable (30 minutes to 1 hour) amount of time to ensure aircraft can safely avoid the area.","30000","30000","30000",TRUE
"196","While cruising at 10,000 feet we experienced some moderate turbulence. A few minutes prior there was a report from a preceding aircraft that there was moderate turbulence between 4 and 7 thousand feet. We had slowed down to 270 as per the Operation Manual in anticipation of turbulence at the lower altitude. We also were approaching some clouds that were just around our flight altitude and I called the Flight Attendant (FA) to tell them to expect turbulence as we were about to start a decent. As soon as we got into the clouds we hit the moderate turbulence. It continued all the way through 3 thousand feet. Subsequently we received a call from the A Flight Attendant saying that someone was injured in the rear of the aircraft, she wasn't sure if it was the B Flight Attendant or the none FA. We were still being knocked around at that point and the First Officer (FO) and I discussed it quickly and told the A Flight Attendant to stay seated until we got lower and out of the turbulence. We leveled off and reported the moderate turbulence to ATC. We called her and told her that this was as smooth as it was going to get and to check in the back. She called back very shortly to say the B Flight Attendant was injured, and as she said it 'he's in pretty bad shape'. I wasn't sure if that meant he was unconscious or bleeding, I should have asked for more specific info. I elected to inform ATC of the medical emergency because I wanted to get the B Flight Attendant assistance as quickly as possible. We were within 20 miles of our destination and I figured that was the safest thing to do. I wasn't sure that we were through all the turbulence anyhow. We got vectors to a short final, the FO contacted the ops and told them the situation, and we were able to land within 10 minutes without further incident. The A Flight Attendant had the passengers remain seated while the EMTs arrived and attended to the B Flight Attendant. I was waiting at the flight deck door when he walked up with the EMT and walked with him up the jetway. There had been a non-rev FA in the back who helped him. Apparently when I called him regarding the lower turbulence, he started putting away his cart in the back and when we hit the turbulence the cart came out and hit his shoulder. Thankfully he wasn't seriously injured, and thankfully no one else was either.","","10000","10000","10000",TRUE
"197","At FL230 while deviating around thunderstorms a red warning light illuminated, shortly followed by a right engine low oil pressure annunciator and a right engine oil pressure gauge initially at 60 PSI, then within seconds fluctuating in the yellow arc. At that instant I assumed pilot flying duties and informed ATC, squawked 7700 with a request to ZZZ airfield. Engine torque was immediately reduced below 2000 torque (idle) on the right engine and the appropriate checklists were followed and completed while receiving a steer to ZZZ, our return field. Once in range of ZZZ, center handed us off to approach and a downwind arrival with vectors were given for a visual approach to a landing on Runway 36. Once safely on the runway I elected to secure the right engine in the hope of preventing further possible damage. This was totally within my capability and I did not consider it an unsafe action. After clearing the active runway we followed after landing and shutdown procedures and were towed to the ramp. Note the above reported engine indications remained constant from onset to engine shut down. For maintenance, Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) and oil temp were normal.","","23000","23000","23000",TRUE
"198","This was an IOE training flight with a new hire student. During our preflight planning we looked at weather and NOTAMs and didn't see any significant weather along route of flight except some turbulence. We pulled up an aviation weather website and saw moderate turbulence prediction for [near our route, but] it looked to be north and east of our route. We saw the jet stream had moved south. When we became airborne we started hearing PIREPS for moderate turbulence through altitudes we were transiting so we slowed to turbulence penetration speed and actually a little slower; 270 KIAS. We also heard a SIGMET for moderate turbulence. We were given an early turn off of our SID to direct to a fix on our arrival. This turn took us further south of original route. At FL240 while in the climb to cruise we experienced severe turbulence. We made a PIREP report and then determined the crew and aircraft were ok. There was no ACARS report of lateral or vertical Gs exceeded. The autopilot was on and never disconnected. After landing we made a write up in the Aircraft Maintenance Log (AML) and interviewed with maintenance followed by mandatory flight safety report.Like windshear, it's difficult to detect where turbulence will be encountered. We had also looked on our flight plan release at the tropopause windshear column for the clues that there would be turbulence on our route; shear of 10 knots or more indicate turbulence. The numbers we had didn't indicate severe turbulence. It would help pilots to have a 'picture' of the area affected; like we saw on the aviation website. But we don't have WiFi on aircraft and are busy with the task of flying and navigating. Also a direct routing clearance can take you off track from what you know about your route of flight and planning.When a SIGMET comes out, the only real help is other PIREPS given by pilots at altitude. ATC has the most updated info. If you are on a direct route it is difficult to ascertain if you are near the affected area sometimes. The iPad is a great tool but we have to know how to analyze the SIGMET quickly. So while we are flying it would be helpful if upon checking in with ATC they could tell us the threats along our route; not that turbulence was reported south of such and such VOR that we have never heard of. Information needs to be meaningful and timely to be useful in a dynamic and busy environment.","","24000","24000","24000",TRUE

"206","I was scheduled to fly a six leg day in the Falcon. On the preceding day, I spent several hours doing the necessary preflight preparations to assess the weather, runway lengths, and fuel options for the lengthy day. The scheduled trips involved extra attention to runway lengths, performance numbers, terrain, and passenger loads in addition to coping with less than ideal weather. With the flight plans filed and a plan of where to purchase fuel, sufficient for the performance required, I felt prepared for the upcoming day.[The night before the flight, I] did a final check of the weather. It looked like it was going to be an interesting day ahead with the remnants of a hurricane lurking on the east coast. I went to sleep feeling ready to accomplish the flights safely.[The morning of the flight] I did the entire preflight and loaded the catering before the Captain arrived. When he arrived and picked up our manifest, we discussed the weather and the difficulties of the day. At this point in time, the Captain seemed stressed and concerned as he announced that our risk assessment was in the yellow or approaching the yellow for the entire day, which I concurred with. Winds, weather, and runway length were the greatest contributors.Due to performance issues and terrain, the Captain elected to fly the [first two] legs. These legs occurred smoothly, even when weather deteriorated and we had to shoot the LDA down to minimums. I did the best I could to encourage the Captain to use the new checklist and FMS cues that are now in our manual. The Captain did not use the new procedures and preferred to use TCS instead of calling for a climb mode. Instead of requesting the Pilot Monitoring to move the knobs which is our Standard Operating Procedures, the Captain would turn the heading and yaw damp buttons for himself even after I had solicited their selection. This resistance to newly establish procedures set the tone for the rest of the legs to follow.After landing in VFR conditions and a quick turn, the Captain asked me to fly the [next] leg. At the time of departure, the winds in [destination] were less than 20kts and the ceilings were around 2000 ft, however the weather was deteriorating faster than forecasted. The flight was a short hop and my approach briefing was interrupted with a runway change that would leave us high and fast for a closer runway. Soon we were getting radar vectors for the ILS 13L approach and I was required to re-brief the approach. As the Pilot Monitoring prepared the FMS and I finished briefing the procedure, we were given a speed restriction of 180kts. During our vectors, I announced that we were too high to be capturing the glide slope based on our present position. I advised the Pilot Monitoring that we were above glideslope intercept. The weather conditions were quickly deteriorating and we were experiencing moderate turbulence and wind shear.ATC removed our speed restriction and issued a turn about 3 miles from the final approach fix. This because this was a close turn onto final, I called for the Pilot Monitoring to lower Flap/Slats 1. The Pilot Monitoring did not lower the Flaps/Slats and shook his head while saying, 'ummmmmm not yet'. As the designated Pilot Flying, I announced again, that I wanted to slow down to go down. I asked the Pilot Monitoring to verify that our speed restriction was canceled and he did not respond. I wondered why the Pilot Monitoring did not configure the aircraft right before the final approach fix. Standard Operating Procedures require the pilots to configure the aircraft before the final approach segment to ensure that the speed is stable and that the aircraft is in a safe condition for the approach and landing.At that time, ATC issued our turn onto final saying, 'maintain 2100 until established, cleared for the approach and contact tower'. For the third time, I called for Flaps/Slats 1 and requested for the gear to be extended. Instead of moving the flightcontrols, the Pilot Monitoring called the tower and set the altitude select to 2100 feet. During this entire time, the aircraft was at an acceptable speed to configure. After he was done with his radio call I asked him for the fourth time, for Flaps/Slats 1 as I began spinning the Vertical Speed knob down to catch the glideslope below us. As I was descending to capture the glideslope, the Pilot Monitoring shouted, 'you're going to be too fast.' The speed was 180 with an increasing trend, and I responded by deploying Air Brakes 1. [Our] speed stayed 180 or less while we were experiencing windshear of +/- 10-15 knots consistently. The Pilot Monitoring notes we will be too fast for the approach without configuring, and decides to respond to my four previous requests to configure the aircraft. At the same time, as the Pilot Monitoring yells, 'We're too fast,' I disengage the auto throttles and retard the power because the automation was not keeping up with the gusty conditions. I knew that managing the power manually would be safer for the approach.  I turned the auto throttles off with one click, which did not promptly silence the warning, just as I heard the Pilot Monitoring announce the GS intercept. As we caught up with the glideslope and the plane began to raise the nose to the three degree path, the Pilot Monitoring was still prompting me to slow down. The auto throttle cue was still chiming and the Pilot Monitoring was distracted enough by it to vocalize, 'turn it OFF already, or I'm going to do it' and began to reach over to shut it off. I responded with 'I've got it' and silenced it with my thumb. Despite my efforts to slow down and become configured on the approach in a standard manner, I allowed the plane to get too slow for the turbulent and windy conditions, because I chose to listen to the Pilot Monitoring rather than fly the aircraft according to my experience and training. In the bumpy conditions, as the airspeed decayed, the low speed cue protection system announced, 'increase speed'. I responded by pushing the power levers forward half way and noting the aircraft speed to be 137 and increasing. The Pilot Monitoring's response was to yell, 'POWER' and 'what the hell' as [he] chose to retract the air brakes. Windshear of +/- 10-15 knots continued and the 'increase speed warning' was heard again. This time, as I was pushing the power levers all the way forward, the Pilot Monitoring came from behind and pushed my hands all the way forward while yelling, 'POWER' to make sure the power levers were at maximum. After a couple seconds, and again verifying the speed was safe, I reduced the power levers to an appropriate setting for the approach. This recovery was followed by a series of berating shouts, 'come on....You can't do this to me, I thought you were better than this... Do you have this or not?' To which I responded, 'I got it'.  Once I called that the aircraft was stable, I was using the thrust vector guidance and the the flight director to keep the aircraft on track with the approach. Due to the turbulence, our speed continued to be +/- 10kts and occasionally +/- 15. I called for Flaps/Slats 2 and Pilot Monitoring extended them. I selected to fly 145 with manual speeds based on our calculated approach speed. Instead, the Pilot Monitoring then reached across and selected manual speed of 150 with no explanation. Standard Operating Procedure is for the Pilot Flying to call for the approach speed to be set, and for the Pilot Monitoring to set the requested speed. I decided to maintain the higher approach speed to ride out the bumps. I called for FS3 (Flaps/Slats 3) and then we broke out of the clouds and continued visually the rest of the way to the runway. There was a crosswind at about 45 degrees to the wet runway, gusting over 29kts as I touched down.     As we taxied across the Bravo Bridge to the FBO, the Pilot Monitoring was still upset and continued to verbalize that I shouldn't have allowed the airplane to get that slow. I apologized and continued to pay attention to the taxi route.After giving a lot of thought to the details leading up to the LSC (low speed condition) event, I can accept full responsibility for allowing the aircraft to get too slow on approach. If I had exercised more focus and superior airmanship, I would have put my full attention on flying the aircraft and I would have caught it before I ever got that slow. I fully understand that I should never have become distracted enough with the failure in communication to allow my instrument scan to slow down. Based on my experience as a 4000 hour pilot, I knew we were already high above the glideslope when I noticed how tightly we were being vectored. Because of this, I called for Flaps/Slats 1 and gear down. When the Pilot Monitoring did not act or respond to my requests as the Pilot Flying, I should either deployed the air brakes to slow for the approach or called to go-around. Looking back, with 100 hours of experience [in this] aircraft, I let my focus shift because of the Pilot Monitoring's lack of action to configure.  This inhibited my ability to stay ahead of the aircraft. Likewise, turning off the auto throttles without turning [off] the autopilot provided a false sense of security. In the future I will maintain a speed that is more conservatively above approach speed and below the FS (Flaps/Slats) and gear limitations. I will use the air brakes as required to be at the appropriate speed when the Pilot Monitoring cannot or will not configure the aircraft. Also, if the air brakes are out, I will keep my hand on the lever to remind myself to stow them when the speed is acceptable. If I deem that the auto throttles are not keeping up with the required speed, I will disengage both the autopilot and auto throttles to obtain a more real feeling of flying and controlling the aircraft. Finally, when CRM is failing in the cockpit, I will do my best to aviate, navigate, then communicate. If I had been aviating and not fixated on our poor communication and the fact that Pilot Monitoring was delaying our configuration of the aircraft until the last possible second, I would have caught the speed decreasing as the autopilot raised the nose to join the normal glideslope. Other safe and appropriate options in our situation would be to request a go around or vectors back to final.  The next time that I feel the crew does not have the aircraft configured at the final approach fix and is not ready for the approach, I will resist the temptation to fall into the hazardous attitude of 'Get-there-itis'.","","2000, 2100","2100","2100",TRUE

Instead, we continued the approach thinking we would be able to easily identify all the step down altitudes. We crossed the first fix at 2,300 feet and then descended all the way to 1,000 feet MDA. By doing this, we missed the 1,640 feet mandatory level-off at the second fix. We broke out of the clouds at 1,200 feet just as we received a low altitude alert from Tower.

"252","We were assigned FL360 on the flight to DFW. While in cruise, we were working our way around a line of ThunderStorm (TS). I was pilot flying and we deviated south to avoid two large cells. After deviating south, we were told to proceed direct CLEWS on the KLNDR2 RNAV arrival. We were beginning to turn back toward CLEWS when we thought we were clear of the weather. ATC confirmed this by instructing us that we should be able to turn back toward the intersection in about 2 minutes. As we came around the corner, we encountered a large buildup/cell that was not painting on our radar due to the shadow from the first storm and also was not reported by ATC when we were advised that our route looked clear. By the time we were able to clearly see it, there was no way to avoid it. I pulled the thrust back to idle in order to slow the aircraft below Turbulent Air penetration speed in a short distance, since we didn't have much room. As we got into the cell, we began getting large airspeed fluctuations, one of which resulted in the airspeed dropping very rapidly to about 180 KIAS. As the speed unwound, the Captain called it as I was already reaching for the thrust levers. I pushed them up to the detent, but by the time the engines started to spool, the Pitch Limit Indicator came down and the shaker activated for a brief moment prior to the airspeed starting to recover. The autopilot disconnected, and I pushed the nose down slightly to avoid the shaker/pusher and to help rebuild airspeed. It appeared to be a large downdraft that caused the speed to unwind that quickly. The speed was still hesitant to increase, so I pushed the thrust past the detent into TO-1. Once the speed started to stabilize, we brought the nose back up to a level pitch and recovered our altitude. We were somewhere between 350 and 355 when I saw the altitude reverse into a climb. ATC queried us and we notified them that we lost about 500 feet due to the turbulence and were recovering back to FL360.The stick shaker as a result of not adequately reacting to the airspeed loss caused a UAS in the stick shaker activation with moderate to severe turbulence.My experience level with flying through buildups at such high altitudes was also a factor as it took me a moment longer to process it than it should have, and that resulted in activation of the stick shaker. I also allowed the airspeed to build up slightly higher than may have been necessary due to my uncertainty about whether or not airspeed was sufficient to fully recover. I erred on the side of building up more airspeed as opposed to less.Be more cautious with airspeed deviations in the event you are not able to avoid a TS cell.","","350, 355, 500, 36000","36000","36000",TRUE

ATC was task saturated rushing the pattern- after slow speed event I took control of the aircraft, declared missed approach, stabilized the aircraft on downwind, reduced automation level to basics and turned aircraft back over to First Officer (FO) for a visual approach and landing- FO is new to aircraft, very low time in FO seat, and mostly assigned FB position since qualified, coming from MD80- FB was heads down during event pulling up continuously changing approaches issued by approach controlCONTRIBUTING FACTORS- Little to no sleep due to continuous turbulence at lower altitudes during breaks resulting in being awake for 24hrs.Carriers may be following the letter of the law, complying with crew rest FARs, FAA training requirements, and union contract limitations to stay legal and compliant. But carriers and the FAA collectively fail to get out from among the trees and step back and look at the forest, or big picture.Safety is severely compromised when pilots are rushed through a fast paced course into a new, highly complex, and automation intensive aircraft, transitioning from steam gauges and cables, then relegating them to the back seat (FB) to 'watch' without 'doing' for years. Add to this an occasional assignment on reserve to the FO seat, place them in a situation of severe sleep deprivation that equates to being legally drunk, send them to arguably the most demanding environment in the international system with malfunctioning automation, turbulence, and where ATC issues clearance changes that would make a sim check feel like kindergarten, and you have the making of a forest fire. These are serious safety issues, they continue to exist, and speak to core issues which all the human factors classes and new FARs are not addressing.Avoiding this type of event, and others like it, requires policy changes. No amount of human factors pie charts, graphs or pep talks will change that the underlying premise that no one wants to step back and look at the big picture issues because changes will likely cost money.My suggestion, for starters, is to have newly qualified FOs (especially from the MD80) be assigned high density domestic legs for one or two months before going international and being relegated to the FB seat for years. We restrict CA's to 100 hours in the seat before becoming unrestricted. Does an FO not have the same learning curve?","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","6000","6000","6000",TRUE
"262","Just prior to the flight I got a weather brief from Flight Service.  They suggested flying further down the coast to an area that appeared to have light precipitation (GPT) in order to get on the back side of a broken line of thunderstorms.  I re-filed with ATC to the recommended fix just prior to departure.  As we approached the area, the onboard Garmin XM weather showed only light precipitation (green and light green) and no lightning in the area we wanted to fly through.  We were in cruise flight and at 28,000 feet.  As we got close to the clouds I call Houston center and reconfirmed with them my line and direction of travel.  Center commented it looked good with only light to moderate precipitation returns.  After we got into the clouds we started to experience heavy turbulence for 3-4 minutes followed by about 5 minutes of relative calm with another 3-4 of heavy turbulence during which we saw flashes of lightning.  We were in the clouds about 10 minutes and after getting out we called Houston center and reported heavy to severe turbulence so they could warn others.  They asked if there were any injuries and we replied no. As we continued flying, we noticed that the pitch and rudder trim were not working but as the plane was already trimmed for level flight, we continued to destination.  We flew an approach and the plane was somewhat difficult to keep on line but all systems worked (flaps, gear, etc).  Upon landing and exiting the airplane, we noticed several carbon fiber 'blowouts' on the trailing edges of the rudder, wings and horizontal stabilizer.  Also we noticed that the rudder cable had either broken or was very loose.  We had the [plane towed] into a hangar to start looking at the extent of the damage.  I was amazed at the amount of turbulence and lighting we experienced given the rather innocuous XM satellite picture at the time of the occurrence.","","28000","28000","28000",TRUE
