They immediately assigned a heading of 120. A correction by the captain was established when the first officer told the captain he had the leans. After that the first officer reported the wind, which was not a factor. (The winds were calm to 10 knots) Soon after a heading of 140 was assigned.

My sleep on the night before could best be described as decent, not great, but okay. Late in the morning of this day I began packing for my three day trip that began the following morning. I live in ZZZ and have been commuting to Chicago for just over a month, having recently changed domiciles. I had briefly looked at the weather in Chicago, it wasn't awful, it was marginal at best with some strong crosswinds. I figured things would be delayed, and based on the delays I saw earlier in the morning, it didn't look like much. Although, due to the weather forecast I thought it would be a good idea to give myself multiple flight options (4-5) just in case there were any issues. I showed up for the first flight that departed around XA35pm. It was delayed an hour. When I finally spoke with the gate agent she said the jumpsuits were full and I was #11 on the stand by list, it didn't happen. Just a short while earlier, the flight had many open seats and very few stand by passengers listed. After they began rerouting passengers and canceling flights, this flight began to fill quickly. Option for flight #2 was an Air Carrier Y flight, that I had been listed for, left around XB30. I ran to that flight just to learn it had been canceled. I ran back to the other terminal to try to catch the next Air Carrier Z flight. This would be the third flight I tried, since I had missed the first two. I would ultimately get on. Boarding began at XB:15pm, however scheduled departure time was now showing XD:15. We boarded - then deplaned - then re-boarded again. After it was all said and done we finally pushed off of the gate around at XE34pm and after an uneventful flight we touched down at ORD around XGpm. After exiting the runway we headed toward the 'penalty box' due to ALL gates being unavailable at ORD. We sat there for well over two hours waiting for our gate. When we finally pulled up to the gate, my watch read XJ05 am. Needless to say, ORD was an absolute mess. I headed for the bus shuttle center to catch the hotel van. Two of the vans came by, dropped off, picked up and left. But there were so many other people waiting in a huge line for the [hotel]. I called the hotel and was informed it could be well over 45 minutes or an hour before we would be pick up. At this point I was fighting a loosing battle with fatigue. At XJ40, I realized that I would only have a few hours at most for a sleep opportunity, followed by almost 8 hours of flying later that day. I knew then that I was fatigued and was not fit to fly for a XO25 show time. In the interest of safety, I decided that I must take action to remove myself from the sequence. I called scheduling and was removed from my trip. I waited about 30 minutes before deciding to just pay for a cab to the hotel. After a mix up at the front desk and after waiting in another line there for 30 more minutes, I walked into my room and the clock read XK44.I am writing this report to bring light to some of these types of issues that can arise while commuting and the fatigue that is associated with commuting. I must admit I was briefly hesitant to call off fatigued right away because I was afraid of loosing the pay credit for my 3 day trip (18 hours worth). Ultimately, I determined the most correct and responsible thing to do was to remove myself from the trip as it simply was no longer safe for me to be reporting to fly that morning per Vol 1.","","","","Air carrier First Officer reported he chose to call in fatigued because he was unable to obtain proper rest prior to his flight assignment.","","",FALSE,FALSE

I initiated our circle, turning to the right approximately 60 degrees (more than would normally be required for the circle).

I completed the turn to final and we landed.Suggestions: More adequate spacing between us and the preceding aircraft would have negated the tower's instructions for us to alter our planned circling path. I believe by lengthening the circling path and the amount of turn required, the expected geometry changed. This added to the workload, making glide path management more difficult.

I said to the First Officer (FO) 'we just lost an engine' as I looked at the EICAS and saw the ITT (Inter-Turbine Temperature) of Engine #2 climbing through 1,100 degrees Celsius. The FO was the pilot flying, so I told her that I'm pulling back thrust lever #2 and to disengage the autopilot (AP) and get trimmed up. Simultaneously, ATC called with climb instructions, at which time the FO reported the lost engine and declared an emergency. ATC asked if we would like to return to the airport. I took over the radios and said yes. (Although it would have been preferable to hold off on notifying ATC until more troubleshooting was done, the fact ATC happened to call at this time with climb instructions prompted the FO to report our engine failure and declare an emergency. I felt I would go ahead and respond, although briefly.) We were given a right turn and descent to 16,000. I wanted to assure that we were stable before maneuvering, so I spent the next few moments observing to make sure we were properly trimmed before re-engaging the autopilot and started the turn and descent. I requested and the FO agreed that she would focus primarily on flying the airplane while I handled the checklist and other pertinent items. While this was occurring, the Flight Attendant (FA) also called to ask us if we were aware of the loud bang. I told her we lost an engine and were returning to the airport and I would call her back as soon as I could. Precisely the same time, ATC requested souls on board and remaining fuel. I told ATC to standby as I verbally diagnosed whether the engine failure was severe damage or otherwise to determine the checklist to run. I checked N1 and N2 and saw there was still rotation, checked oil quantity in Engine #2, 12 quarts remained, and observed there was still a small indication of oil pressure. Also, I felt and heard no unusual vibration and observed that Low Pressure and High Pressure indications were in the green. The ITT indication was now dashed, but there was no indication of fire. Based on the above, I ran the Engine Failure/Precautionary Engine Shutdown checklist. We continued to get descent and vector instructions from ATC. We were originally given direct to ZZZZZ Intersection for the ILS 8R, but was offered RWY 27 by ATC. I asked for the WX and was told calm winds and ceilings and visibility above minimums. It was a bad WX day, with low ceilings and some moderate cells in the area, so RWY 27 worked better for us. I asked for and received some vectoring to get around the stronger cells. I called the FA back to give more details. I let her know time to touchdown, and no brace and evacuation would be necessary. I also requested that she make an announcement to the passengers regarding our return as I felt the priority was to complete the set up and briefing of the required instrument approach. (She was calm and professional, and based on the customers reactions at the gate afterwards, handled the situation in an outstanding manner.) Again, prioritizing my time and duties, I requested ATC to notify the company of our emergency and airport return. The FO flew the approach, the aircraft was configured and the checklists were completed in a timely fashion. I did call the FA one last time and she stated all the passengers were secure and the cabin was prepared for landing. We broke out right around 300 feet AGL and landed without incident. After exiting the runway, we requested ARFF to circle the aircraft to ensure the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate. They cleared us, and we taxied to the gate. Obviously there could be a very long discussion about threats, errors, and undesired aircraft states in a major event such as this. I believe the most important reaction is to relax, fly the airplane, establish strong communication among the crew members, identify the issue, and resolve as best you can without creating even larger issues by diverting your attention away from flying the airplane. There are always improvements that can be made on any flight, not only in emergency situations. The events were discussed afterwards among our crew and I am certain we will all be better for it. I am proud of my crew and overall I think they did an outstanding job.","","","","An EMB-145 engine failed during climb through FL190 so an emergency was declared, the QRH completed and the flight returned to the departure airport.","300, 1100, 19000","300",FALSE,FALSE

Aircraft then entered a downdraft and lost 700 feet of altitude in about 10 seconds. ATC called and said to maintain FL300, we told ATC we were in turbulence and a down draft. Aircraft climbed back to FL300.","","We were in cruise flight at FL300. Radar was in calibrated and auto mode. There were some light green returns on the radar on our right side but no different than returns we had seen for the last 100 or so miles while getting a good ride. We were about 30 NM north of the OMN VOR and started to get moderate turbulence, then got an updraft which pushed us up about 200 feet followed by a significant downdraft which caused us to lose 700 feet. The aircraft was on autopilot the entire time and the FMA showed ALT CRUISE. We got a burst or two of moderate rain which caused significant radio static which is a common problem in the Airbus. I could barely hear the controller say to maintain FL300 to which I replied that we were in moderate and greater turbulence. She responded to return to FL300 as soon as possible. There was no traffic showing on the TCAS at the time. The altitude loss was probably a duration of one minute or so from the time the downdraft began until we were back at FL300.I can only guess that a rapidly growing cell was below us. The new radar in the advanced airbuses does seem to sometimes paint WX less severe than the older radars when in the calibrated position. We were in an area with a lot of other aircraft on basically the same route and no one was deviating or reporting significant turbulence. There were no injuries. I would call the turbulence moderate to severe. The jolts were moderate but downdraft was similar to a mountain wave in that the aircraft could not overpower it but the ride during the altitude loss was not terribly violent.Although not a causative factor in this incident, the airbus radio static problem should be looked into. Whenever you are in cold precipitation it is sometimes impossible to communicate due to the static. I have never experienced that to this degree in 23,000 hours in many types of aircraft. I can only conclude it's a design flaw.","","A321 flight crew experiences moderate to severe turbulence at FL300 causing a 700 foot altitude loss with the autopilot and autothrust engaged.

Ended up three hours delayed due to not having an alternate on our release when we required it, thus not having fuel for the alternate. Ended up 2+ hours delayed due to waiting for fuel and unloading bags after passengers decided to deboard and then pretty much starting from the beginning paperwork wise. Ended up departing finally. Takeoff was normal, noted on climb aircraft required slightly more than normal left rudder trim when I looked at how coordinated the aircraft was flying. Added trim to center the 'ball', engaged AP and away we went on the flight. Ended up doing an ILS app into our destination thus did not land the aircraft due to it being a CA approach so I was not able to feel what the aircraft felt like when landing. Landed and again, repeated the MEL procedure before departing. Before our first departure noted the Rudder Trim was 1/2 deflected when trimmed during climb and cruise. During descent, we noted aircraft required even more trim to have the ball centered, up to 3/4 of total trim being used to fly coordinated. Noted indicator was working properly if we were able to fly coordinated by applying the correct amount of trim in and in what the normal direction would be if it had been operative. After landing on the next leg, we took all trim out to neutral while taxing and the aircraft pulled to one side.Looking back at the situation, if I had seen how much rudder trim was in, I could've noted something didn't added up. Also, we then noted that in cruise and in the descent into ZZZ, when the aircraft had been trimmed out to perfectly centered, the rudder pedals too were displaced correctly thus verifying that the Yaw trim indication was correct if what showed matched with what the rudders were doing. When we arrived at the gate, I discussed with the CA if that MEL was correct since the indicator seemed to work but the aircraft was still flying uncoordinated and required huge amounts of trim. After we realized how much trim was needed to fly coordinated, we figured it would be very hard to maintain control of aircraft in the possibility of an engine failure with less rudder available with all that trim set during flight, possibly leading to control issues in that scenario. Called Maintenance to verify MEL and they had agreed that the MEL didn't match up. Aircraft ended up being taken out of service due to not being able to figure out what the main problem could be. The MEL wording for Yaw Trim indication was vague when CA read procedure to me. Didn't specify how exactly to verify Rudder Trim was to be set to neutral. Also, with the delays and the huge mess that morning it could've led to just skimming over the MEL. I could've also checked the can but was task saturated with being on the radio with Ops, Clearance, Dispatch and the communicating with the gate agent about the status of the flight. That A/C can had at least three write ups for the same problem and all the corrective actions said were that a flight control test had been done to correct it. Initially, when brought up to Maintenances' attention, there was a disconnect between us as to why this was such a huge problem until it took us a few attempts to explain why this could be a huge issue. Although it didn't present any flight control issues during our normal flights, engine failures can happen (one happened recently here) and could have turned an Incorrect MEL procedure error into a bigger issue had something worse happened. Many of these MEL issues not corresponding to the correct write up stem from Maintenance trying to find a MEL to attach it to thus solving the problem and getting the aircraft out with minima l delay. Sometimes, not a whole lot of reading is done to ensure the MEL being used agrees with what is trying to beMEL'd. We could use quality control in the Maintenance department. to prevent these issues from happening over and over again. Aircraft looked normal and I did not see any visible damage on the aircraft during my walk around that would suggest that there was some bigger issue with the plane causing it to fly that un-coordinated in flight.","","[Report narrative contained no additional information].","","An ERJ-175 rudder trim indication was MELed, but the crew discovered after flying two legs that substantial left trim was needed for coordinated flight.

Upon reviewing the departure and reading the 30R initial climb instructions, we had put in the routing instruction altitude of FL190. Our failure came primarily because of the assumption that waypoint SPTNS was an 'at or above 5,000 feet' altitude as opposed to 'cross at' altitude.We were in IMC conditions after rotation and were being bounced around a bit by a 767 heavy wake that departed in front of us, and that kind of flustered us.  Other than that, conditions were calm.The altitude deviation was exacerbated by the pilot flying making the assumption that we were under class B airspace and could only fly at 200 knots, so the aircraft being relatively light and at full power was climbing at well over 3,000 feet per minute. When tower handed us off to departure, I did check in verbally that we were 2,000 feet climbing FL190. Within 3 minutes after departure, ATC told us to stop climb at around 7,000 feet and not to climb until passing waypoint SPTNS. I do believe that a transition to a faster climb speed would have probably made us cross SPTNS at 5000 feet.I did manage to call NorCal ATC when we arrived.  They did say that this is a new departure with the restrictions and are experiencing some growing pains with it. I guess my first suggestion would be to have Clearance assign the initial altitude. My other suggestion would be to put an alert box with the information sign on the TECKY1 like they have on the SJC9 departure plate. That is very easy to see and quickly identify. The SJC9 also has the maintain altitude at 5,000 feet and then also in bold letters.  This would be very helpful print on the TECKY1.The TECKY1 RNAV is a very simple looking departure and I think that CRM was lagging a bit because of that as well. As pilots I think we are a little more paranoid when we see many step climbs and altitude restrictions on departure or arrival plates. In retrospect I think both pilots should have read the departure out loud.","","Misinterpretation of SID (TECKY ONE RNAV DEPARTURE)SJC is underneath SFO class B airspace (starts at 8000 ft.), climbing at 200 KIAS and combination of IMC, minimum safe altitude of 5600 msl, 19000 as transition altitude, resulted in crossing SPTNS fix at higher altitude than what's depicted in the SID. 19000 as initial altitude seemed logic since you want to get away from mountains surrounding airport as soon as you can. I should have asked clearance delivery to explain that clearance since it was pretty new. (Only [a few] weeks out) On initial check in with departure Pilot Monitoring stated 'CALL SIGN, 1200 climbing 19000', ATC acknowledged.Clearance delivery should state 'climb via SID except maintain 5000' so there is no misinterpretation is it 5000 or 19000 ft. as initial altitude.","","Flight crew reported deviating from an altitude restriction on the TECKY1 departure from SJC. Chart design and wake turbulence were cited as contributing factors.","200, 1200, 2000, 3000, 5000, 5600, 7000, 8000, 19000","19000",TRUE,FALSE

The controller reported to us, and other aircraft on the frequency, that around that area of weather there was reported moderate turbulence from FL320 all the way up to FL360 or FL380, I cannot recall but we were about to hit that area. Being downwind of the weather, with the wind at around 63 knots out of the southwest and the reported turbulence, we decided to take a wide deviation to try to be as clear as possible of any eddies and/or downwind turbulence we may encounter, on top of the already reported moderate turbulence. Throughout the deviation we experienced 3 pockets, of about 10 seconds each, of moderate turbulence, while experiencing continuous light turbulence; most of it was due to erratic wind speed and direction changes inside the reported area. While deviating, the controller became worried that we were leaving radar coverage, and asked us how far or how long before we could turn on course to URSUS. I was still deviating, although we didn't have that much to go, and I told him that we had about another twenty miles before we could turn on course. He said that he was not painting any weather and I needed to turn to a heading of 220, I believe, to which I replied that we were unable to do so, that the most I could turn in about a minute would be a heading of 200 or 210, I cannot recall. He said he understood that I was using my PIC's emergency authority to not comply with an ATC instruction, to which I replied that that was affirmative. A minute later we were clear of the weather and we turned towards URSUS, letting the controller know we were done deviating. It is worth mentioning that while we were deviating, we could see on our Navigation Display's TCAS information, that there were a number of airplanes inside the area of weather we were painting, and where the controller said he wasn't painting anything. Those same airplanes were reporting moderate turbulence, so strong, we could actually hear the voice of the pilot talking, jumping around and changing tone due to the jolts they were experiencing. There was no way I was going to turn the aircraft any sooner towards URSUS. One, we were painting weather, and Two, those guys to our right were getting an awful ride, while ours was manageable. I'll also like to add that the controller was very professional and courteous throughout the event, not just to us, but to all aircraft deviating.","","","","B737 Captain reports using his Captain's emergency authority to avoid turbulence associated with a thunderstorm, beyond what the Controller would authorize due to Radar coverage.","32000, 36000, 38000","32000",TRUE,FALSE

We called back to the flight attendants to see how things were going and to communicate our aircraft swap and gate information with them. The flight attendant in question answered the interphone. She was talking very loudly and with slurred speech. She did not sound like her normal self. We both were very alarmed by this behavior. We completed that quick conversation with her, waited a few minutes and called back hoping that the 'A' flight attendant would answer the interphone, she did. We obtained her assessment of the 'B' flight attendant, which was that she was acting very strange to include talking loud and slurred speech. The 'A' flight attendant said she was embarrassed by her behavior and concerned that something was wrong. On the flight deck we decided to take action. We coordinated with the controlling dispatcher, requested medical assistance, and discussed a possible diversion. We called back to the cabin again to verify the 'A' flight attendants assessment.

At XEROX, still on approach, the controller issued the clearance 'XXX maintain 3000 FT and fly heading 140.' I initially didn't hear our call sign and thought it sounded like a clearance for another aircraft in the terminal area. After determining that the clearance was in fact for us a go around was initiated with the autopilot at first on and then disconnected, the turn to H140 was slow and altitude of 3,000 FT over shot by 550 FT.The clearance caused some level of confusion and delay since 'go around or discontinue approach' phraseology was not used by the controller. From that point better high altitude/approach and go around procedures and crew coordination were required in this situation. Better pilot/controller communication. Expecting the unexpected, with more thought given to go around procedures at a point other than minimums.","","While on the ILS approach to Runway 23L at IND, the aircraft was descending through roughly 2600 FT on the Localizer and glide-slope (captured and tracking) autopilot was on. The Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Monitoring (PM) were discussing items relative to the approach when the Controller announced 'maintain 3000 FT fly heading 160.' No one seemed to hear it, except me, an Relief First Officer (RFO). While we were already below 3000 FT, it would be impossible to maintain something we had already passed through on the Glide-slope. Regardless, I asked PM, the First Officer to verify with ATC that those were indeed our instructions and that they were intended for us. PM at that point confirmed with ATC that those were our instructions. Never did I hear the terms cancel approach clearance or go around, perhaps those words were 'blocked'. Upon execution of the 'go around' we exceeded our clearance altitude.Improper, or non-standard phraseology during assignment of Go around/missed approach. Standard phraseology, probably would be a good idea to have controllers and pilots talk face to face from time to time, perhaps recurrent training or the like.","","IND TRACON issued a go-around to an air carrier at 3,000 FT on approach to IND Runway 23L but the flight crew missed the command because of a nonstandard phraseology.","550, 2600, 3000","3000",FALSE,FALSE

The following is my account of the event, to the best of my memory. After rechecking the weather and NOTAMS at ZZZ1 and ZZZ, I started the aircraft at XA:27 EST. While taxing to runway 23, I turned the TKS system on to the normal setting and noted that the high pressure light was bright yellow. I contacted Center and obtained my clearance. I was cleared as filed, up to 8000 MSL. Prior to my departure, I did one last check of the weather at ZZZ1 and though the ceiling had lowered from the time of my arrival, the temperature was a few degrees above freezing. ZZZ was reporting marginal VFR with 10 miles of Visibility, scattered clouds around 1700 AGL, with overcast around 2000 AGL. I departed at XA:31 EST.I flew the published departure which is a climbing right turn to R270 off of ZZZ1 to 4400 MSL then on course. At 4400 MSL I contacted Center. After several minutes they responded '[Aircraft X], radar contact, climb to 8000, precede direct HVQ.' My climb was slow and it was difficult to maintain heading and airspeed due to moderate turbulence and a 40+ kt headwind. After passing through 5500 MSL I noticed my groundspeed was 97 kts. Knowing that the winds were stronger above 6000 MSL, I requested from Center to level at 6000. After 4 or 5 minutes at 6000 MSL I noticed my airspeed had dropped from 170 MPH, to 165 MPH. I then took my flashlight and shined it on the wings. The spinner had roughly 2 inches of Rime ice, the props were starting to coat with ice from the root to the edge of the ice strip, [and] the wings were covered from the top to the bottom of the leading edge with about an inch and a half of Rime ice. While inbound to ZZZ1 from ZZZ2, I was able to get on top of the clouds at 10,000 MSL. It was clear above 10,000 MSL to the stars, with negative ice. This was my first out. Also, while inbound to ZZZ1, the freezing rain and sleet turned to rain only while I was passing 4,800 MSL and ZZZ was marginal. That was my second out. Knowing that the wind speeds were higher above 6000 MSL, and seeing how much ice had already accumulated in the amount of time it took for me to climb to 6000 MSL, I determined that the amount of time it would take me to climb to 10,000 MSL, and the rate of which I was accumulating ice, I would not be able to make it to 10,000 feet. At this time I elected to go to my second out and turned the TKS to Maximum. I asked Center how low they could get me and informed them I was picking up ice at a rate faster than I could shed it. The controller then said the lowest he could give me was 5900. I told the controller that I would take it and started down the one hundred feet. The controller then said he could get me lower if I flew a 270 heading for 15 miles. I was hesitant to take it because I knew it would lengthen my time enroute to ZZZ but decided to take it after seeing that I was still accumulating ice on the wings and props. The controller then cleared me to an altitude that was only a few hundred feet less. Then, a minute or so later, he cleared me to an altitude less than 5000 and gave me a heading of 300. Several minutes later he asked for a ride report. I grabbed my flashlight again and checked the wings, props, and spinner. The ice had increased since I checked it last, and since turning the TKS to Maximum. I also noted that my airspeed had dropped 10 MPH in the last 5 minutes. I then explained all of this to the controller and he gave me a heading of 310 and said to contact ZZZ and that they would be able to get me lower. I contacted ZZZ and asked if I could get direct to the airport and asked what the lowest he could give me would be. He cleared me direct and said the lowest he could give me was 3500 feet (I think) but said he could get me lower when I got closer. I took the 3500 and noticed that the airspeed was dropping at an alarming rate. I continued towards ZZZ and a couple of minutes later my airspeed was down to 129 MPH. I then told the ZZZ controller that I needed lower. It was then that he [registered] me [as] an emergency and gave me a descent to 3000. I accepted the clearance and went down to 3000. A few miles further the controller gave me 2200 MSL and I descended. The controller offered me an altitude that would've been 50 feet above the mountains, which I think was 1700 MSL, but I told him I was not going any lower until I was within 10 miles of the airport. Knowing that the temperature at ZZZ1 was above freezing and the elevation is just under 3000, along with the fact that ZZZ was reporting overcast above 2000 AGL and temps above freezing, I thought I would get out of the ice faster than I did. However, it was not until I got a visual of ZZZ that I began to shed the ice. Normally, when the ice begins to come off it sounds like one of the switches on the overhead panel being turned off, or like a circuit breaker popping. This time it sounded more like cannon balls hitting the side of the aircraft. When I was about seven miles south of ZZZ, I was able to call the visual. It took 3 6 second bursts of TKS on the windscreen, and until I was short final for runway 23, for the pilots side of the windscreen to clear. By the time I landed, most of the wings were clear. I landed in ZZZ with no flaps and long at XB:23 EST. The tower had alerted the emergency trucks and they were waiting for me. After I had the aircraft under control on the runway the tower gave me taxi instructions. The trucks followed me to parking. After parking and shutting the aircraft down at XB:24, I got out and was met by the emergency responders. Because the copilots windscreen and the nose were not touched by the TKS, they still had substantial build up. One of the responders asked if the same amount of ice that was on the nose and windscreen was on the wings and I told him yes but it was worse. He then said that was the most ice he had seen on an aircraft that landed. I then answered some questions about my flight from the head responder and gave him my personal information, certificate number, and phone number. I then called my Chief Pilot.","","","","Aero Commander 500 pilot reported encountering 'severe' icing conditions that resulted in greatly decreased airspeed.","3500, 4400, 4800, 5500, 6000, 8000, 10000","6000",TRUE,TRUE

However, the airplane recently transferred ownership so it was not RVSM approved. We advised ATC prior to our climb, and they cleared us to climb non RVSM to FL410. After we switched controllers a few times, Washington Center asked us to climb to FL430. While in the climb, we noticed our performance deteriorating as we approached the maximum ceiling for the aircraft (FL450). We constantly advised approach that we would need more time to make the climb, and they were fine with the slow climb. Upon reaching our cruise altitude of FL430, the airspeed began dropping and we were only climbing at 100 feet per minute. As we began to level off, the autopilot disengaged and we experienced stick shaker for the first indication of a stall. The pilot flying lowered the nose to prevent a stall, and the aircraft descended 800 feet in the recovery. At this point, we requested FL420 or FL410, but the controller denied it. When we requested a descent to FL280, the controller requested a turn 20 degrees left, but we couldn't turn very quickly with the imminent stall situation. Therefore, we took the turn slowly to be safe.Contributing Factors - the captain had never flown above Fl410 before and high altitude flight/stalls had never been discussed in any of his training. This was my first trip in the Beechjet since I completed my training. Almost all of my training was performed in a simulator below 10,000 feet at low speed flight. Not only was I nervous and overwhelmed with my first trip, but I didn't know what to expect.Actions - The captain noticed the stall indication and immediately reacted accordingly. As the PM, I notified ATC immediately.Inactions - both of us failed to realize that our poor climb performance would affect our ability to level off, maintain altitude, and cruise in turbulence at high altitude.","","About 10 minutes later the controller asked us if we were able to climb to FL430. We responded that we 'needed a few more minutes at FL410'. Eventually we were asked to climb. Initially the aircraft climb was acceptable, but passing FL420 we were unable to maintain 500 fpm in the climb. As we were leveling at FL430 we encountered turbulence, the airspeed began decreasing, and a stall was imminent. I asked the non-flying pilot to advice ATC that we had to descend immediately due to inability to maintain airspeed and we would take vectors if necessary.Our airspeed was still not increasing rapidly so I initiated a very shallow banked turn. ATC asked why we weren't turning fast enough etc. we were given a number to call. Upon landing at our destination, I contacted the ARTCC manager as advised. He was very nice and explained that we needed to keep them apprised in the future if the aircraft could not perform as expected. He said everything was 'ok'.","","Two corporate pilots with modest high altitude experience were asked to climb to FL430 for traffic. As they approached their cleared altitude their BE40 would not maintain airspeed nor climb and they had to be vectored off course for traffic and were cleared to descend. 7-800 feet were lost in the maneuver as the turn off course was completed with little bank as the stick shaker was active.","500, 800, 10000, 28000, 41000, 42000, 43000, 45000","41000",TRUE,FALSE

Our planned arrival fuel was 7,000 lbs. An alternate was neither required by regulations nor filed. The Captain coordinated with dispatch to add another 2,000 lbs. of fuel.During cruise, we monitored the destination ATIS. It alternated between VFR/no precipitation, and IMC/TSRA. We were filed and cleared for the AYBID transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. Due to weather, Jacksonville Center re-cleared us direct HURDE, which was on the OMN transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. We advised dispatch. As we approached HURDE, there was a large area of moderate/heavy precipitation west of the arrival, broken areas of moderate precipitation southeast of us, and scattered areas of light/moderate precipitation with some turbulence markers in front of us along the arrival. There was a thunderstorm over PBI, with other scattered areas of thunderstorms moving toward it as well. Our plan was to pick our way through the weather, then hold until the storm over PBI moved, or divert to FLL. FLL was VFR and no weather was south of PBI.In rapid succession, the following happened:-ATC advised us of another airline flight reporting severe turbulence while attempting to arrive at PBI. We instructed the flight attendants to take their seats.-ATC advised us of hail in a large cell 20 nm SW of HURDE, which was moving toward HURDE due to wind.-Another airline flight in the area reported moderate turbulence and turned around.-Another airline flight on the arrival started asking for large deviations around weather.We asked for a 30 degree left turn to avoid a cell in front of us. As soon as we turned, we encountered continuous moderate turbulence, moderate rain, and St. Elmo's fire. We had not yet even entered any of the precipitation painting on our radar. The gaps in the weather in front of us were closing up, and we were surrounded by weather on both the left and right sides. We asked for and were cleared for a left 180 degree turn to the north. I advised dispatch that we had to turn around and may need to divert. We were offshore, and weather extended up the east coast of Florida (off our left now) all the way up to just south of Daytona. No matter what we did next, we would need to go up to abeam Daytona before turning west. We discussed that we could possibly go north to abeam Daytona, west to the west coast of Florida, south around the weather, then east into PBI. The problem was that this would leave us with little extra fuel to hold or divert to FLL if the thunderstorm over PBI had not moved off.We discussed the situation and the captain decided we were diverting to MCO. I advised dispatch. I then saw that in response to my previous message, dispatch sent us several messages instructing us to work our way west through the weather. The worst weather was west of our position, and again, there was no way to go west until we went back north to abeam Daytona. I then was very busy reprogramming the FMC, and talking to ATC, the flight attendants, passengers, and MCO ops. The captain was very busy working our way around weather to join the arrival into MCO.I was not able to coordinate with PBI ops because they do not answer the radio. On a flight on the previous day, on this flight prior to our diversion, and later on this day on a subsequent flight, PBI ops did not answer the radio on the ground or in flight. I later confirmed with PBI ops in person that the frequency on our airport data page is correct and they claim the radio does work.When we were set up for the diversion, I had time to look at received messages from dispatch again. I saw there were numerous messages asking us to again pick our way through the weather west (incorrectly claiming it was clear that way), to divert to FLL if a diversion was necessary, and then to confirm our intentions (I had already clearly stated that we were diverting to MCO). This added to our stress because of previous management inquiry into and threat of discipline toward other pilots who have made decisions to divert contrary to company guidance.I messaged dispatch one last time, stating we were not able to comply with their request due to weather, that we were diverting to MCO, and that we would call them when we were on the ground. We were approaching 10,000 feet. We decided that the numerous, excessive messages from dispatch were becoming a serious distraction, and that we had to wait to communicate with them further until after we parked.We diverted to MCO without further difficulty and landed with, I believe, about 10,000 lbs of fuel. After parking, we checked the PBI ATIS and radar imagery. We saw there was still a storm over PBI and weather in between us and PBI. We believed we could possibly have overflown MCO arrived in the PBI area with 6,000-7,000 lbs of fuel, and then gotten into a bad situation with no further extra fuel to hold and minimal fuel to divert to FLL. This was exactly the scenario we were concerned about, and this confirmed our decision to divert to MCO.I saw there were several more messages from dispatch similar to the previous ones, and then finally a message with an amendment for our diversion to MCO based on 'the captain using authority.' The captain then called our dispatcher while I did the walk-around. The captain described the dispatcher's response to the captain's attempt to explain our concerns and decision-making. He described the dispatcher's response as rude and dismissive.We coordinated with dispatch and MCO ops regarding weather, passenger concerns, use of the tarmac delay snack kit, etc. After refueling and a brief delay for maintenance, we continued to PBI. All of the precipitation had moved off to the east by the time we departed MCO. Dispatch sent us several messages about the weather moving away during our flight to PBI. We completed the rest of our trip without further incident within our normal FDP.PBI Ops must answer the radio. Dispatch should have seen the massive area of weather moving across our arrival and the scattered area of storms over PBI and originally planned for us to arrive with more than 7,000 lbs of fuel. Dispatch could have filed us for the WLACE2 arrival into PBI to come in around the back side of the storms, which were moving east. We could have asked to be re-filed for the WLACE2 arrival. Dispatch could have kept us updated about the weather while we were enroute. We could have asked for updates about the weather while enroute. However, based on past experience, it is hit-or-miss whether dispatch will respond to such requests. Dispatch provided us no information prior to our message stating we had to turn around for weather. A proactive suggestion to request a re-route would have improved our situation. Instead, dispatch later provided us a distracting overload of information in an attempt to avoid a diversion. They attempted to convince us to follow a plan that would have burned all of our extra fuel and put us in a position with no remaining good options. The company culture causing this reversal of priorities needs to be improved.","","","","Air Carrier First Officer reports diverting to an alternate airport due to thunderstorms over and in the vicinity of their destination airport, against the wishes of their Dispatcher.","10000","10000",TRUE,TRUE

This resulted in a go around and we tried another attempt to land. On the second approach, ATC issued a microburst alert, resulting in another go around. While performing the go around, we received another windshear warning. At this point it was obvious we were not going to get into ZZZ and decided to return to the departure airport. While on the way, we realized that the airport had switched to a northbound operation which caused us to show a landing fuel of under 1500 lbs. Reserve on this flight was 2200 lbs. We then decided due to the low fuel, our only option was to land in GSP. While on the way, we showed landing with under 2200 lbs of fuel and declared min fuel to ATC. The conditions in GSP were not much different than in ZZZ or the departure airport, reporting windshear on final and other aircraft that had previously had to go around. As we were becoming critically low on fuel and multiple passengers were vomiting in the back, it was clear that we needed to land urgently. While on final, we received another windshear warning between 1000-1500 feet. I made the decision to continue the approach and not go around as we had no other options and only one go around could possibly be done with the critically low fuel. I wanted to make sure I had the go around available to me if it became necessary to save the aircraft while critically low over the runway, so I made the PIC decision to fly through the windshear warning as we were still flying and had some altitude to work with. We ended up landing safely in GSP with 2000 lbs of fuel on board and the wind conditions rapidly deteriorating. This event occurred due to the windshear conditions at all the airports in the area. We appeared to have plenty of fuel on board when we left and as there was no real convective activity along the route, I was under the impression that the flight would be windy, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The second attempt into ZZZ and the subsequent turning around of the departure airport also compounded the issue. My decision to continue through the windshear event in GSP was caused by the lack of fuel and lack of options available at the time and I feel it was necessary to be done to safely get the aircraft and the passengers on the ground while still having a little fuel left over in case of an extreme emergency close to the ground.This can be prevented by not sending airplanes into the air with a smaller fuel load when extreme windshear and microburst conditions are present at nearly all the available airports in the area. However, the conditions deteriorated rapidly and there may not have been enough warning to plan for multiple failed approaches and a subsequent diversion.","","","","CRJ Captain describes a diversion caused by a windshear on the first approach and a microburst alert from ATC on the second.

Substantial thunderstorm activity was along our route and we were immediately thinking how to break track if this didn't improve immediately. Moments later, we lost our Mach Airspeed indicators, which spun down, our speed tapes dropped to minimum speed, and the auto throttles advanced along with an immediate stick shaker. We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however I was immediately task focused on flying the airplane. [Past aircraft accidents] came to mind. I disconnected the auto throttles, autopilot and hand flew the jet, referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly. We had no reliable airspeed indications and a stick shaker, in Moderate turbulence in IMC.  I added thrust, as I was fighting Moderate turbulence, and flying wings level and a relative known pitch, and with virtually no airspeed references, I resorted to an approximate known fuel flow of about 4000Lbs/engine and pitch slightly above the Horizon. (Knowing cruise would also be about 1.55 EPR and pitch 2.5-3.5).We [advised our situation] on 121.5. Got a response from several aircraft, one was helpful and relayed our position and [situation] to Oceanic on HF Radio. I turned right to break off of the track, and was having to navigate between thunderstorms the best I could while in IMC. Knowing that ideal would be to get to 15NM parallel track, however with all the weather, I believed other aircraft may be deviating this distance left and right of track, and 15NM Right/South of track was not possible with the weather. 25-30 miles or halfway between tracks probably would be safer in such an emergency, and with no airspeed references.  My FO was accomplishing the QRH Smoke Fumes checklist and checked with me prior to turning the left Recirc fan off, which changes many things to vent any smoke/fumes, and since we were already diverting, I nodded and said yes, do it. We flew approximately 20-30 miles off to the Right/South and set up a direct to the departure airport which the ALTN page showed as the nearest airport.  We set up FL240 in the MCP Altitude window.  I started a gentle descent, as aircraft controllability was of significant concern without reliable airspeed indications. Turbulence was still BRUTAL. Airspeed indications came back and were lost 3 different times, and I adjusted power based on what we had. Additionally I was having substantial right engine vibration of 5.0, and while I had no airspeed indications. Still in solid IMC, I was trying to differentiate between unrelenting turbulence, the stick shaker, engine vibration possibly due to ice crystal icing, and possibly airframe vibration/buffet possibly due to higher Mach speed (by feel) to which I reduced thrust gently to combat. I resorted to an approximate fuel flow and pitch as often as I could. We closed the right engine (#2) bleed, and opened the isolation valve in the event that the fumescould have been partially coming from the Right engine, since its N1 Vibration was at 5.0, which was Amber in color. This did not have an effect on the fumes on the airplane. My knowledge of the Ice Crystal Icing procedures above FL250 was to have Engine Anti Ice ON (already was on) and avoid suspected conditions (we already were trying to get out of it). We were task saturated.  Mindset - When we initially got the electrical smoke/fumes/smell during the high level of turbulence followed by the loss of all airspeed indications, since we weren't flying over any yellow or red radar echoes, had no moisture indications on the windshield, no sulfur smell, my thought immediately went to a chaffed electrical harness supplying heating to Pitot/Static and possible other systems, which may have been the source of airspeed indication failures, rather than Ice Crystal Icing causing Airspeed/Mach Indication losses, and the electrical fumes were very strong.  My FO had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating, so we did not choose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist. My thoughts were to get off track far enough to avoid deviating aircraft, reverse course and descend to lower altitude both to safely get below the tracks, below the headwinds, other aircraft, and possibly out of the IMC so as to resolve any icing issue if we had a partially heated system, out of the turbulence to stop any electrical wiring chaffing and into VMC to help fly the airplane with more references, and less task saturation. After established heading back at FL240, an approximate speed of 280 knots indicated, Airspeed indications which had returned had stabilized and I was able to engage an autopilot and autoflight systems. The Engine Vibration indications (N1) were normal and not indicated in Amber. At this point we were able to talk with ATC and complete a phone patch with our company Dispatch and Maintenance folks. I explained the Fumes, the loss of Airspeed indications, the Right Engine vibration, etc. and was headed back. We contacted Approach with our position and were given FL240. They provided us a SQUAWK and cleared us direct. We reassessed the cabin situation, and I gave the passengers a PA explaining what we had, as far as the electrical smell/smoke concern and our decision to return. I did not explain the flight instrument failures or vibration issues, as this was not of concern to the passengers and would have been of no benefit to them. We eventually were provided landing data, which showed us possibly landing a couple of thousand pounds over structural landing weight but well under performance limits. My thoughts were to reassess the condition of the smoke/fumes as we got closer to the airport and determine if two slight further airports may be a better option. As we got closer, an assessment of the conditions indicated that all things were stable, no increasing smoke/fumes were being generated and while time was important, things weren't dire. The flight attendants indicated that the level of fumes would come and go but weren't increasing at this time. The weather at our destination was rapidly deteriorating, winds down the runway at close to 40Kts, as were in one of our optional airport, but the visibility at our destination was at 1 mile, mostly due to rain, which was below the Cat C landing minimums and reported to be deteriorating in rain. That was no longer suitable. The other two airports were the same in time, and with the fact that winds were high and one airport had one runway, I didn't want to get in the possible situation of some aircraft getting disabled on the runway there and us having to go to the third airport anyway, so the decision was made to go to the largest of our alternative. An uneventful landing was made and we taxied to the gate, followed by emergency vehicles as they were examining our aircraft continually. At the gate the fireman looked for my thumbs up and he returned the same and we completed our parking checklist.","The reporter stated that the aircraft was removed from service and returned only after completion of extensive maintenance procedures during which no systems anomalies were found. The reporter recalled the timeline and sequence of the anomalies. Because the Air Data and Standby systems have no physical connection and the respective systems failures occurred sequentially, the reporter has not ruled out the possibility of ice accretion, which the pitot static and engine anti-ice/deice systems were incapable of coping with. The airspeed indications' return to normal occurred sometime after the air turn back and during the descent, but the reporter does not believe the aircraft was in complete VMC conditions, just a thinning cloud cover. The most puzzling component of this event was the burning electrical odor which QRH did not describe in the Loss of Airspeed checklist.","We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however we were immediately task saturated and focused on flying the airplane. The Captain disconnected the autothrottles, autopilot and hand flew the jet. We were both referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly. We had no reliable airspeed indications, a stick shaker, in Moderate turbulence, all in addition to being IMC. The Captain was flying the best he could, which was fantastic; using known pitch and fuel flow settings to maintain altitude and airspeed. Our altimeters seemed to be accurate.I had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical-burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating, so we did not chose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist. We also decided to keep the aircraft cold since passengers were getting motion sick. Our thoughts were to get off track far enough to avoid deviating aircraft, reverse course and descend to lower altitude both to safely get below the tracks, below the headwinds, other aircraft, and possibly out of the IMC so as to resolve any icing issue. Not to mention, getting relief from turbulence, which may help to stop any electrical wiring chaffing, and into VMC to help fly the airplane with more references. After established a heading back at FL240, at 280kts indicated, the airspeed indications, which had returned, had stabilized and the Captain was able to engage the autopilot and auto-flight systems.","","A B757 developed electrical fumes at cruise followed by the loss of all airspeed indications in IMC with turbulence.

We had previously sat the passengers down when we had light turbulence and we instructed the flight attendants to be seated immediately via PA.  Captain and Flying First officer were in bunk on their sleep shift.  We left the autopilot hooked up to help with control but the typical slow throttle corrections had me overriding the thrust settings to keep us out of the over speed and stall regions.  We were initially at FL370 but requested climb to FL390 as we thought we may get out of the turbulence because of the forecast (FL310-370) although this forecast ended about X Airway.  Optimal according to the FMC was approximately FL390.  When we finally attained clearance (CPDLC) and climbed it was actually worse and only reduced our margins.  The whole event was probably 10-15 minutes.  Aircraft control was maintained although the Auto Pilot was having a difficult time maintaining level flight.  I was ready to take over if it kicked off but felt overall it helped to have the Auto Pilot on.  We then asked for FL350 but it took over 3 minutes to get this approved (CPDLC and HF).  The biggest threat I felt was the airspeed changes with violent wind shifts and different velocity of the wind.  We never had an over speed although we were close many times but we had it go into the slow range above stall many times and I was concerned about stalling out this aircraft several times.  Near the end of the event we had the low hydraulic quantity #1 EICAS.  By the time we got to the checklist though we had lost all fluid and pressure (couple minutes with altitude changes, reports to HF, VHF for aircraft behind us, etc).

I believed he must be referring to me since I was the only one in the pattern.  I replied I was 'Bonanza XYZ.'  He then came back and ask for contact information.  He stated he needed it for a deviation report.   What happened?   I was ready to leave the airport after having some maintenance done on my airplane.  I tried to contact the tower on what should have been the same frequency I used when I arrived (126.25) earlier.  Getting no response from the tower I taxied from the ramp to the runway for a 24R departure.   Here I attempted to contact the tower three times and received no response.   After receiving no response I departed Runway 24R.  I saw no traffic ground or air.  I thought the tower must have been closed.What I believe happened:  I later discovered my number one radio appears to be intermittent. I found it to be cutting in and out when transmitting.  It is possible I thought I was transmitting and no transmission was going out.  Basically radio communications (or lack there of) contributed to this.

While in turbulence my charts iPad were knocked onto the back seat floorboard.   He had cleared me to land 15L.  However my airport diagrams were on the floor and I did not want to proceed to the airport and make a mistake and choose the wrong runway to land on.   So I stated I wanted to leave the area and I headed southeast toward my home airport until I could get my charts secured and reestablish position.  I was able to retrieve the charts (iPad) quickly and then proceed back to the airport.  I reestablished communications with the tower and was again cleared to 15L where I proceeded to and landed without any problems.  I mention this because I do not know what the Tower controller was complaining about. To correct this....

Enroute we determined that the main gear were still extended, we checked the alternate verification and saw two green lights for mains no green for nose gear. We discussed configuring early to see if we would be able to get normal green lights by use of normal gear extension. At about 30 miles we attempted to extend the gear normally. We selected gear down felt no transition and saw no lights on the normal landing gear indicator. Next we conducted the alternate landing gear extension procedure, we were only able to use floorboard lights to determine that the gear was extended.

Due to a ZLA LOA requirement, I also had 4 KLAS arrivals descending to FL300. I noticed that Aircraft X was an issue with the last of the KLAS arrivals, and turned Aircraft X 15 degrees right, to fall behind. During the shift we had bad rides anywhere from light chop to moderate chop to moderate turbulence. Aircraft Y who was further east entered the airspace at FL340. Halfway through the sector (about 5 minutes prior to turning Aircraft X), Aircraft Y asked for a better altitude, I had then stated that I no complaints at FL300. Aircraft Y asked for FL300 and I descended the aircraft.While Aircraft X began his turn, I noticed that Aircraft Y was also traffic, and was planning to get Aircraft X on course at the earliest time. I cleared Aircraft X on course, and had he done the turn right there, this would be a non-issue. Aircraft X slopped his turn (possibly due to the winds) and I recognized that I was not going to have separation with the current status (just slightly over 2 minutes out). I called ZLA and APPREQED Aircraft Y descending to FL280 for traffic, they said approved. I keyed up to issues the descent, 'Aircraft Y descend and maintain FL280 for traffic.' I believe I issued a 2,000 feet per minute descent rate (I know this is not 'valid' but I know that it helps convey a rate needed, and is used as an advisory). I waited, and received no response. I keyed up and said the same thing, then waited, no response. I keyed up a 3rd time and issued the descent. After the 3rd call, Aircraft Y asked if I was calling him. I said yes, then issued the clearance for the 4th time. The pilot waited a second, then responded with, 'Can you confirm the altitude for Aircraft Y?' I reissued the clearance, and told the aircraft to expedite and that I needed him 'Out of 29 in a minute of less.' Aircraft Y waited a second, then read back the clearance. I then told Aircraft X to expedite his climb and to report out of FL310. At that point, Aircraft Y said that he had the traffic in sight, 'Traffic in sight 6 miles in front 400 feet above.' And Aircraft X on his own said he had the 4 o'clock traffic. Aircraft X was at FL305 climbing, Aircraft Y level at FL300, 2 hits later, I lost separation at circa 4.8 miles, the next hit was around 4 miles, I saw as close as 3.75 nm between the targets.All the time, ZLA had the hand off on Aircraft Y, after APPREQING the descent, ZLA never changed the data block. I know that around 3.75 miles I had 1,000+ feet, because I finally saw Aircraft Y out of FL295. But I cannot tell you what I really had. After Aircraft X was out of FL295, ZLA changed the data block to reflect FL280.I firmly believe that I would have had separation had Aircraft Y responded to the first clearance. It took 5 transmissions to get the clearance to Aircraft Y (in my opinion that is unacceptable). My back up plan was to descend Aircraft Y. I went to execute the backup plan and Aircraft Y didn't listen. I really feel that I let the ATC system down. I trusted that the pilots would listen and follow directions. I have had a handful of close calls in my career, but up to this point, I maintained separation because the pilots responded on the first call. This situation really caught me off guard. I didn't expect so much effort to relay a descent clearance to Aircraft Y. I am truly sorry. I could have stopped Aircraft X at FL280 and never climbed him above the traffic. But I was trying to provide the best service possible. And providing that service caught me.Having pilots that listen.

ATC notified us ZZZ1 was 12 miles ahead. Considering the emergency, weather and the shorter runway [at our destination] we elected to divert into ZZZ1.

Due to a low altimeter setting, less than 29.92, I queried my First Officer (FO) to ask ATC to reaffirm our holding altitude. After doing so, and with numerous aircraft receiving clearances, the ATC controller, seeming somewhat agitated, restated that we were instructed to hold at FL180. I instructed my FO that this was an unacceptable FL due to the altimeter setting and to advise ATC. Unfortunately, due to numerous arrivals and simultaneous ILS PRM approaches in use, we were not able to advise ATC of the unacceptable clearance. At this time, we were descending on the arrival, and entering the hold. Slowing, and turning while entering the hold, alpha protection started climbing on our PFDs. Noticing this, my FO called out 'airspeed'. I responded to his callout, looked at my altimeter, believing I was passing through 18,700 and called for 'flaps one'. He checked his altimeter and positioned the flap handle in flaps one position. At this time, knowing the max flaps extension altitude being 20,000 feet, we both believed and confirmed that we were within aircraft limitations.Although aircraft saturation and weather were a significant factor, what appeared to be an ATC controller unaware that FL180 is unusable with a local altimeter setting of less than 29.92, added to the confusion, not only in communications, saturated approach control frequency, but the workload in the cockpit of transitioning from the descent phase to the approach phase. ATC must limit speed restrictions in the flight levels to nothing less than 250kts IAS.","","","","A321 Captain reports being given holding instructions at FL180 with a low altimeter setting making FL180 unusable.

During that time erroneous indications from the Captains and First Officer's Artificial Horizons made the pilot flying lose proper heading to the next fix. Throughout the next several moments both crew members communicated the indications being viewed on both sides of the flight deck. The Captain (pilot monitoring) had a 20 degree bank to the right in his ADI and the First Officer also had the same indication. The standby horizon was indicating wings level and a nose up attitude in the climb. Crew communications with ATC were made at that time to alert the controller of possible deviations from course but we believed we could still appropriately maintain altitude at all times. After minor trouble shooting it was believed that the standby horizon was the only instrument indicating the correct information. No circuit breakers or associated flags were popped nor flags in view of any guidance instruments. The crew contacted operations and received a diversion release for new fuel burns etc. for the rest of the intended flight. The flight was diverted to a destination other than the original destination due to the low IMC conditions at destination and were given several other locations to fly to in the event that the instrumentation got worse than what it was. The crew at times were still unsure of the proper heading and attitude due to the gyros not sending good information to the instruments. Because of this the crew asked the controllers several times to verify current track and to be aware that we could only follow the wet compass for the best heading and it appeared to correspond with the ground track of the GPS. Flight was continued to the new diversion airport with the assistance of ATC guiding the aircraft to a visual approach. All normal checklists were followed and a safe and uneventful landing was conducted.","","During climb out the controllers had issued the crew a new clearance. As the pilot monitoring (PM) I had begun to make the appropriate changes to our course indicators, frequencies etc. to begin on the new route.  While I was performing these functions the Pilot Flying (PF) (First Officer) selected Airfoil Anti Ice ON and Engine Anti Ice ON without my knowledge. I believe shortly after the selection was made the Master Caution had quickly illuminated and extinguished (I cannot be exactly sure in what sequence that happened as I was unaware he had selected the Ice ON, it was not discovered immediately). At the time I was unaware of what annunciator had made the Master Caution illuminate. Then I had noticed the First Officer was using full MCL power during his climb with the ENG/Airfoil Ice selected. He should have been using a reduced setting of .08 less than what the RAT MCL was calling for. Almost immediately after the communication was made to the First Officer to use the reduction in power I became aware that the Master Caution had illuminated due to the Left Ice Protect Temp HIGH annunciator illumination. I began another scan quickly to check engine indications etc. to verify that the aircraft was still operating normally prior to reviewing the Cockpit Operating Manual for further instructions to clear the annunciator. As the scan took place it became evident to me that we were in OAT of approximately PLUS 22 C. This is well above our limitation of 'never operate' the Anti-Ice system above plus 10 C. My first action at that time was to select all Anti Ice systems OFF and verify that we were truly not in icing conditions. Then I communicated the violation to procedure of the first officer selecting the Anti-Ice without my knowledge and that we just need to discuss future items prior to selecting them to insure compliance with limitations and other variables. It was determined that we were not in icing conditions and if we continued to climb we would eventually require the Anti-Ice system in the future. I contacted ATC and asked to level off our altitude and described the problem to ATC. ATC allowed and we leveled at FL190.  The COM procedure had already been accomplished by the time we leveled off. OAT at FL190 was approximately plus 8 and it still took the annunciator several minutes to extinguish. The procedure does not elude to 'began diversion to nearest suitable' nor does it say 'continue operation' with associated side to the high indication in the OFF position. After the annunciator extinguished and several moments had passed with no other abnormal indications to the system I elected to continue our climb to our filed altitude with only the Right Airfoil selected and if the Ice Protect Temp Low lights had illuminated I would attempt to allow for the Left side to assist. All associated annunciators remained extinguished for the remainder of the climb. This flight had no other abnormals involving the Anti-Ice systems. But the flight was diverted due to other instrument problems and poor destination weather.I heavily believe in 'Guard the Good' when referring to precautionary shutdown of an engine and the PF will put his/her hand over a fuel control unit to insure the wrong fuel control will not be selected. Or something like cross feeding fuel is another good example of something that really needs to be communicated prior to the selection. And in a case like the Airfoil or Engine Anti Ice I am not sure why it gets turned ON and OFF so often without any type of communication. If a PM does something as simple as selects 'tail' ice, wouldn't the PF really want to know? I believe this to be a lack of communication from one pilot in this instance and possible a lack of aircraft limitation knowledge. But as a company whole, it does happen frequently that a 'Captain' will select Anti Icing systems ON without any communication to others involved and if he is not the one flying the 'PF' maybe unaware that he/she needs to make a power change. This may possibly be fixed with 'PM' touch instrument style of selection for the Anti-Ice systems. ei. If the PM notices that the OAT is plus 6 or less and visible moisture is present then he or she would announce 'Anti Ice is required'. The PF could then ASK for the selection to be made and the PM would then select the Anti-Ice associated with that scenario. (Inflight maybe more related to PM/PF and ground ops would be more PIC/SIC)","","DC-9 Captain experiences a Master Caution light during climbout due to ENG/Airfoil Ice selected by the flying First Officer with the OAT well above 10 C and thrust not reduced to accommodate the ice selection. After this problem is corrected the attitude indicator malfunctions require a diversion to a VMC airport.","19000","19000",FALSE,FALSE

As we waited we observed all the planes including company airplanes taking off and landing on Runway 10 into a 14 knot headwind, it was a busy day in TNCM this being the weekend. We tried to reset the ACARS with no success, and departure time went by with the passengers onboard and still no release and no tps, without cellphone service we were unable to contact dispatch all operations was telling us was that the paperwork was coming. 20 past departure and the passenger were starting to be agitated as they have been on the plane for an hour. 25 minutes past departure the paperwork showed up and the main door closed and they were ready to push us back, however we were not ready. After loading the MCDU and the performance page prior to push back (in accordance with procedures that became effective the day before) we are also using a hard copy of the load close out as we could not use the ACARS. After route verification, briefing and checklist we are ready to push. Ground control informed us that we did not have a flight plan on file, again we go thru ops and spend the next 30 trying to get a flight plan refilled, and a clearance. 1h15 past departure we takeoff, takeoff was uneventful and we get enroute. Once we got the ACARS back dispatch told us that the performance numbers provided to us were for taking off Runway 28 with the strong tail wind and against the flow of traffic and that by taking off on 10 we were above the maximum takeoff weight for that Runway.- Tps was only showing numbers for one Runway, I must have assumed it was the one in use and overlooked that it was in fact for 28.- Under the numbers for Runway 28 there was a note regarding Runway 10, regarding special departure,reinforcing my mistake that this was for Runway 10.- Before [the procedure change] using uplink you would have been unable to insert number for a Runway that was different from your take of Runway on the flight plan page.- Getting the paper work including TPS on our second flight under the new procedures 20 past departure.- Being unable to contact dispatch or have dispatch contact us.- Being unfamiliar with TNCM.- Task loading and multiple distractions from ATC, ops, Flight Attendats wanting to know what was going on.","","Crew arrived at the airport 1+15 prior to departure [and] at aircraft 1+05 prior to departure. Agent said that paperwork was not ready and would be brought out later. Did pre-flight checks but ACARS said no comm and we were unable to initialize the IRS's and the MCDU Init page was frozen and would not allow any entry. We pondered the problem for 10-15 minutes discussing our options and the First Officer (FO) tried deselecting and reselecting the database and that allowed us to get the IRS's aligned and to enter some information but the flight plan did not load so we were left waiting on the flight plan. We reviewed the runway 10 departure because of the unique terrain features it was noted that tailwind takeoff's were prohibited. We were located on the remote pad facing South so we just waited and watched 15-20 and takeoffs and landings on runway 10 which was right in front of us.. At departure time one of the agents came up and said that they were having problems getting a final fuel load but they would have one shortly. The agent also told us that since the changeover to the new system that they had been taking delays. We still did not have our paperwork at departure time +20. Approximately 10 minutes later the fuel truck showed up and started fueling. The agent wanted to know our fuel load to tell the fueler but I told him that that information should come from ops to be sure the load was correct. By now we are well past departure time. I did hear the FO tell tower that we were 20 minutes from engine start. A few minutes later another agent showed up with the paperwork. The FO entered all of the data and we then verified our flight plan. A takeoff on runway 10 was briefed by the FO who was the pilot flying. On the TNCM field report I noticed that runway 10 was listed first and that 28 was open for departure but only if the winds or direction change but the winds were predominantly out of the southeast.  I noticed that the weather at destination was poor. I believe it was 400 OVC and 1/2 mile. I then shifted my focus to the flight plan to see what our fuel status was. The FO looked at the paperwork and noticed that we had a re-release so a discussion of that took place because I had never done a re-release before. We were ready to go and informed tower of such and was advised that we could push. Tower then had us stop because he did not see our flight plan. There was no clearance on file. I went off frequency and spent about 5 minutes on that issue. After another 10 minutes we still did not have a flight plan so I called ops again and the clearance was re-sent. It went through this time but we still waited about 10-15 more minutes for clearance from San Juan. We were now an hour late having shown up on time and boarded on time. We taxied out and was about 200# from our takeoff min and we were given a re-route. We finally departed with the FO as the pilot flying off of runway 10 and our climb to cruise was uneventful. After level off, we got a message from dispatch wanting to know our winds. We sent back 140/14. He then sent us a message wanting our max tailwind. I sent back that we took off on runway 10 with a headwind. We were puzzled by this exchange so we started double checking everything and discovered that we had been flight planned for a tailwind takeoff on runway 28 against traffic. This is when we realized that our data entry was applicable to runway 28 and not runway 10. Upon landing I called the dispatcher and he informed me that we had been overweight for runway 10 for second segment climb performance. He also stated that he had contacted ground personnel in St. Maarten and had told them to tell us to come back to the ramp to offload passengers and bags. We were never at any time told to return to the gate by anyone. Our workload and stress level increased dramatically when we had no comm with the company and could not load any data or align the IRSs. No provision for an error to be caught on flight closeout with new procedures. We were extremely time compressed receiving the paperwork at departure time. It seemed like we were working 4-5 issues at once. Our focus was on our legalities and safe operations off of runway 10. It did not enter our thought process that we would be given a tailwind takeoff against traffic on runway 28 given the field report. We sat for over an hour and never saw a takeoff on runway 28. There was no reason to get the paperwork at departure time. Due to extreme task loading out CRM broke down allowing an error to go un-noticed. A method of communication with our dispatchers when operating out of a foreign country with no Comm. Give a complete closeout including the runway in use. You may be legal but not safe. A crosswind takeoff out of TNCM with a 7,500 foot runway may not be entirely safe. Get the paperwork upon arrival at the aircraft.","","A320 flight crew describes the problems departing TNCM due to late paperwork, procedure changes and no ACARS.

I was the First Officer (FO) and Pilot flying. We had a 100 knots tail wind on the Arrival and a significant tailwind from the west at this point. We were given vector of 060 degrees, maintain 5,000 feet until established localizer, cleared the ILS 8R. Outside of IF, I joined the LOC on FMS pink needles and then switched to GREEN needles. Then upon LOC intercept and given 190 KIAS until 9 DME. I deployed flight spoilers. We were slightly above glideslope and ATC told us to slow to 170 KIAS. I ordered gear down and flaps 22. Weather conditions were IMC in Heavy rain with significant tail wind. The Captain (Nonflying Pilot) noted another aircraft on TCAS nearby to our right side. Near the 9 DME passing through 3,000 we set MAP altitude 3,000 feet on Altitude alerter. I believe we were inside 9 DME when ATC suddenly told us to turn to heading 180 degrees and climb maintain 5,000 feet. The ambient noise level was louder due to aircraft configuration and ATC chatter. Captain asked ATC for clarification due to another aircraft near that side. We hesitated turning momentarily due to our concern with the close proximity of the aircraft to our right. I attempted to disengage Autopilot (AP) and manually fly the turn and climb, the AP would not initially disengage. I saw a red colored 'AP' on the PFD and hear loud 'Autopilot, Autopilot,' oral while ATC also attempted to talk but was blocked by oral warnings in cockpit. The AP oral warning 'Autopilot, autopilot,' continued to enunciate along with 'GlideSlope' and 'Bank Angle.' The aircraft attitude was in normal parameters. We attempted turning with heading bug but again AP would not work. Eventually AP disengaged and manually in the turn to the right, I heard TCAS, TA 'Traffic' enunciate once. We were then told to climb to 5,000 feet, heading 180 degrees; and then turn to something like heading 220 degrees. While I flew manually, the Captain attempted to reengage the AP and explained to ATC of what the situation was with AP problem. We climbed to 5,000 feet and eventually got AP reengaged momentarily but then it malfunctioned again. I manually flew the aircraft and ATC vectored us around back onto ILS 8R flown manually by me with no further complications. After landing while taxiing we did an Autopilot test and the test was successful.Upon landing ATC tower gave us a telephone number and Captain called TRACON.  The Supervisor said we lost spacing separation with another aircraft landing at a nearby GA satellite airport when we failed to stop descent at 4,000 feet. When we asked Supervisor why were instructed to turn 180 degrees, he stated that the final approach controller (still working his station) was attempting to insert another flight in front of us, but then the spacing did not work out. We suggested that we should have been given a Go Around instead of a vector so close to the ILS final approach fix at that critical phase of flight. Furthermore, our aircraft's abnormal automation behavior and interfering cockpit automation orals and conflicting ATC instructions to turn towards a nearby aircraft further complicated the situation in a critical, time sensitive condition of flight. The supervisor seemed to agree and understood the collective threats culminating into the situation. He said he would talk to the actual controller once he came off his station. And a report must be sent to FAA.The aircraft state was safe and in normal parameters during the vector to approach and initial approach intercept. The threats accumulated as we intercepted the localizer on the ILS 8R. Threats included:1. Weather: IMC, low ceiling and visibility, heavy rain. Strong tail wind with turbulence during STAR descent and transition to ILS 8R2. Other aircraft in unexpected close relative position to our aircraft.3. FO was using new TELEX 750 headset with foam ear plugs instead of the uncomfortable company issue non-sound suppression headset. Captain was using a commercial full-ear covering sound suppression headset.4. Radio chatter and louder ambient cockpit noise level due to aircraft slowing configuration while descending. Made it difficult to hear ATC clearly. FO should have increased volume on new headset when cockpit noise increased on the approach.5. Automation refused to quickly decouple and subsequent loud CAS Orals, TCAS TRAFFIC, bogus GLIDESLOPE and BANK ANGLE orals and Autopilot disconnect Oral made it very difficult to hear entire ATC message of instructions.6. The apparent ATC instructed level at 4,000 feet was not set into the Altitude Alerter while on the ILS glideslope. Flight crew could have been better at monitoring, verification and cross talk regarding ATC instructions. Flight Crew became very busy dealing with multiple threats in just a few seconds.7. ATC's attempt to insert another flight in front of us and give us vectors close to FAF in IMC towards nearby other aircraft should not have happened. We should have been instructed to execute a Go Around. In the future in same situation--I will tell ATC we are Going Around and not turn towards the other aircraft.8. We were not aware of altitude deviation (below '4,000 feet') until ATC informed us during the turn to 180 degrees. 9. Crew's last approach at end of a 4-day trip/ end of duty day. While we were ready for the trip to end and go home--We were not fatigued.I suggest several things to improve upon are illuminated by this event:1. Crew members should use sensory equipment of similar capability level. (i.e., one pilot with an expensive noise cancelling headset and the other with a normal cost pilot headset that does not have noise cancelling. This concept is similar to the military's requirement that all flight crew have same generation of NVGs for vision. The air crew must have a similar sensory experience and expectation of crew mates hearing the ATC. Company should provide better more comfortable headsets so crew members would be inclined to use company issued headsets. I personally will no longer use the TELEX 750 in an EMB 135/145. It is just too noisy.2. ATC should be more cognizant of the impact on weather, airspace, and critical stage of flight on ILS in IMC, imperfect radio communications and cockpit automation oral distractions, on aircrew's ability to manage tasks and hear time sensitive maneuvering instructions. The attempt to have us go down and slow down with such a tail wind while ATC attempted to insert another flight in front of us and then vector us towards another nearby aircraft and the associated pilot cross talk, aircraft orals warnings, improperly performing automation and time needed to clarify ATC's instruction so close to FAF 3. Air crew should have set 4,000 feet in Altitude Alerter when it was given by ATC. But When I heard maintain 4,000 feet, we were already approaching 3,000 feet.In summary, this event is just the type of CRM/TEM Swiss Cheese accident chain of events taught in the school house. I will use it at my next recurrent training class discussion.","","There were many threats starting with marginal weather and a high traffic environment. After being cleared and mostly configured for an approach we were given break off instructions that the crew could not verify due to one not having heard the full instructions. Could not get immediate confirmation from ATC and when we did the loud aircraft warning messages blocked ATC instructions. Timing of and amount of instructions and execution requirements made for a high workload that kept us from executing the instructions.I have to focus more on how to manage my workload in this type of environment. The sequence I choose will certainly impact the outcome of events.","","An EMB-145 on an ILS was taken off the approach for traffic. The crew had difficulty understanding the Controller because the autopilot was issuing failure alerts and would neither turn nor disconnect. Eventually they complied but had a traffic conflict in the process.","180, 220, 3000, 4000, 5000","4000",FALSE,FALSE

ATC had reduced us to final approach speed outside of the FAF.  Shortly after the FAF Monitor told us 'Cancel approach clearance, climb to 9,000 feet and track the localizer'.  Captain disconnected the autopilot, advanced the power and brought the nose up to start the climb to 9,000.  Shortly after I read back the clearance Monitor informed us that tower had a visual on us and proceeding traffic and we could continue the approach if we wanted. I suggested we continue with the missed approach.  At this point we were at approx. 150 knots and starting to climb and one dot above the localizer.  Captain decided to continue the approach and as I was relaying that to ATC he pitched down to regain the glideslope.  Our vertical speed hit 1800 FPM down and the GPWS gave us a 'Don't Sink' and 'PULL UP, PULL UP' warnings.  I called for a go around and captain replied 'I got it.' and continued the approach.  We sank below the glideslope and now had 1000 FPM climb to regain it.  I called 'Unstable, go around' and moved my hand behind the power levers to advance the power if the callout was ignored a second time.  This time Captain initiated a go around by advancing the power, pressing the go-around button and calling 'Positive rate, gear up.'  I prompted for flaps 10, got no response and moved the flaps to 10.  I then stated 'Positive Rate' and raised the gear.  At this point I was able to make a missed approach call to tower and we were told to maintain 9,000 feet and immediately turn to a 080 heading for Airbus traffic.  Captain started a standard rate turn to 080 heading and we were at 6,700 feet when I called 'acceleration altitude'.  We cleaned up the plane and ATC told us to make an immediate turn to 105 heading for the traffic.  Captain increased bank to 30 degrees to comply.  We leveled at 9,000 feet and were handed off to approach control for another approach.Suggestions:Several factors led to this event.  ATC should have never offered to let us continue the approach.  There should have never been an attempt to continue the approach.  Go-Around callouts should have been made and the commitment to the go-around when the approach clearance was cancelled.  An immediate go-around should have been initiated at the first GPWS warning (Don't Sink).  And it should never take two go-around calls to make a go-around happen.","","","","Dash 8 First Officer reported prompting the Captain to execute a go-around after the approach became unstable.","150, 1000, 6700, 9000","9000",FALSE,FALSE

The plane is a club plane. A very complete pre-flight was completed prior to obtaining the IFR clearance. At the run up pad, it was discovered that the data card for the Garmin 430 was corrupted and rendered the GPS function inoperable although the com and nav functions for the VOR capabilities were working satisfactorily. There is a second nav/com (sl30) that was also working properly. This was the first go/no go decision point and the first link in the chain that broke. This being a medical transport (blood run), the pressure to continue to flight was succumbed to. An IFR clearance was obtained but amended from what was filed. Being based in the local area, the amendment was familiar but still added to the stress of the moment. The second link in the chain. Takeoff was normal, climb out was normal and cruise was set at 7000 feet on heading. South of ZZZ VOR I requested of Center a 20 degree course change to the east to avoid a buildup that extended several thousand feet above me. At that time I was VFR over the cloud layer. The request was granted and I changed course. The controller then advised that I should now turn direct ZZZZZ (GPS waypoint) to get back to the airway. It was at this point I realized that I had failed to change my equipment designator from 'G' to 'U'. Third Link in the Chain. Before I could confess and get the designator changed, ATC gave me a heading and told me to acquire the victor airway and disregard the prior order to fly direct ZZZZZ. As I got close to the airway and adjusting course to 151 degrees Center handed me off to Approach. At almost the same time I went full IMC and almost immediately started noticing ice on the windscreen and the wheel pants. I also encountered moderate turbulence and reduced power to protect the airplane structurally. I verified pitot heat, carb heat and defrost was engaged. The power adjustment required a trim adjustment to maintain altitude. My lack of attention to the heading drew the attention of ATC who reminded me of the desired heading. ATC also inquired as to my intentions for landing at ZZZ airport. The icing became worse as did the turbulence and I was becoming more and more alarmed at my seeming inability to keep the wings level and maintain heading and altitude. At one point I wondered if the icing was affecting lift on the wing which was causing the turn. I became more than worried (scared) as my heading had actually gone to 270 degrees while I was attempting to keep wings level and maintain altitude. ATC became concerned and verified my current heading and advised that I needed to get back to 151 degrees. I should have advised ATC of the situation but did not. Fourth Link in the Chain. I believe ATC surmised what was going on. Once I got the plane back on heading, ATC ordered a descent from 7000 to 5000. Soon thereafter I was ordered to 4000 and then to 3000. When I reached 3000 I went VFR. The ice began shedding from the plane and the turbulence ceased. ATC wanted me to advise when I had the [airport] weather. I was unable to get the weather before ATC told me the weather. ATC then guided me to the airport. I was able to see the airport when I was about 5 miles away at which point IFR was cancelled and I landed. Problems that were subsequently identified over and above the problems noted above include a failure to interpret and dig deeper when checking weather for the flight. Additional training on weather interpretation will be completed. More complete disclosure to ATC about the situation needed to be made. In this case it would not have changed the outcome, just the manner in which it could have been handled.","","","","C182 pilot reported encountering turbulence and icing conditions during the flight that led to altitude and heading deviations.

The FO mentioned before departure that he'd been off on vacation for a few weeks prior to this trip. We had two flights that day so I told him he could pick which one he wanted to fly or could fly both to get comfortable again. He elected to fly this leg and the flight was uneventful until we began to descend to DEN. Moderate turbulence in VMC for the last 10 min of the flight. As Pilot Monitoring (PM) I asked for lower and was given 8,000 feet abeam the airport where it finally became only light turbulence. We were given a base turn, called the airport in sight, and were cleared for the visual approach to RWY 35L. The FO lined up for the runway, asked for flaps 1 and began a slow descent while I contacted tower and obtained our landing clearance. I then noticed that we were approaching 1,200 feet AGL outside of the FAF and we were below the glideslope (in VMC). I alerted the FO that we were low and to level off while we finished configuring the aircraft. He did so but the aircraft briefly descended to 1,000 feet AGL before he completely leveled off. We configured the aircraft and were stabilized and landed uneventfully. We briefed and successfully alerted the Flight Attendants (FA) early coming into DEN due to it being a mountainous airport. However, we should have briefed the high airport elevation during the approach briefing so we would have paid extra attention to the RA which would have told us we were lower than we thought.","","As I began to slow the aircraft down I realized that we were too low and at approximately the same time that the Captain stated the same. I had already begun arresting the descent by turning off the auto pilot and hand flying the rest of the approach, noting that we were in Flight Path Angle (FPA) mode and that the altitude window was lower than the 7,000 feet I intended to set. Right after that ATC gave us a low altitude alert call and we continued to a normal approach and landing. After we arrived at the gate, we debriefed the approach and although it was a visual approach and the subsequent landing was normal it felt prudent to make this report.By me being more aggressive in the monitoring of my altitude selection as either I misled my intended target initially or hit the altitude select knob in error at some point. A contributing factor to this may also be having 19 days in between this flight and my last.","","ERJ-170 flight crew reported descending below the glideslope to 1,000 feet AGL on a visual approach to DEN.","1000, 1200, 7000, 8000","1000",FALSE,FALSE

We were instructed to hold south of OWB on the 180 radial @ F240 with an EFC. We acknowledged the clearance and quickly programmed the FMS for the hold. A brief review of the holding page was accomplished and the hold was activated. The Second In Command (SIC) and I immediately began discussing options for a possible diversionary airport. In addition, we were busy with scrutinizing the radar picture to determine any weather that could impact our current holding situation, route to SDF, or route to diversionary airport. We entered holding at OWB and very quickly determined that the holding pattern we programmed was not correct. The incorrect holding pattern rendered us holding north with and inbound course of 180. We immediately recognized the incorrect programming and promptly notified ATC. We told the controller we would re-program the hold and re-enter the hold once we pass over OWB. He indicated that we were fine and we could remain in our current holding pattern. Approximately 20-25 minutes we advised ATC that our current holding pattern was placing us in close proximity to the encroaching severe weather and that we would like to hold on the south side as initially instructed. The controller complied with our request and issued new holding instructions. We entered the new hold and held for approximately an additional 15 minutes. After nearly 45 minutes of holding and no evidence of a pending approach clearance, we coordinated with company dispatch and other departments and diverted. At no point was there any conflict with ATC or the numerous aircraft operating/holding in the vicinity of OWB.I believe good CRM prevailed in this case. My SIC and I recognized the programming error and immediately notified ATC. There was some compression/haste in programming as we were close to the holding fix upon receiving our holding instructions.  In retrospect more time could have been spent during the confirmation and activation phase of programming. This will undoubtedly be the case moving forward. I believe fatigue partially contributed to the event, as it was after midnight and we had already completed 2 lengthy flights prior to this ferry. That in combination with the severe weather surrounding our position posed some great human factor challenges for us.","","","","A G200 Captain reports being cleared to hold south of OWB on the 180 degree radial but inadvertently sets the FMC to hold north of OWB.

We were instructed to taxi to Runway 36L and were told that a wind shear alert had been issued.  As we taxied toward 36L the Captain requested a re-computation of the takeoff data using the wind shear profile.  We discussed the steps in using the wind shear profile and the appropriate changes were made to the cockpit setup to reflect the new runway and wind shear profile. Specifically we discussed the Pilot Monitoring (PM) switching to Flight Path Vector (FPV) after Takeoff Go-Around (TOGA) was selected.  Once cleared for takeoff (winds ~320/21G31) the Captain advanced the throttles, stabilized the power, selected TOGA and stated 'set max power'.  Shortly after TOGA was selected, while the throttles were being driven to the takeoff setting I selected FPV on my Primary Flight Display (PFD).  The engines reached takeoff thrust and I looked at my display in anticipation of stating 'Max power set, Speed Reference System (SRS), 80 kts....etc'.  Instead I said 'Max power set, no SRS' because of the blank Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA)s with the exception of the THRUST display.  Due to the wind and the slower acceleration of the PW4100 series engines, the aircraft was already well beyond 80 knots.  The captain announced 'reject', brought the throttles to idle and maximum braking was initiated by the autobrake system.  I announced 'spoilers' and the aircraft was brought to a rapid stop.  I estimate that the reject occurred at approximately 105-110 knots.  We informed the tower of the rejected takeoff, cleared the runway, and ran the Rejected Takeoff (RTO) checklist and the after landing checklist.  We coordinated with ATCT to find a suitable parking position and contacted [company] for appropriate guidance regarding the high speed RTO.  We were instructed to return to the gate for a maintenance inspection and for refueling as we were approaching our RQR fuel. Brake fans were placed on In Accordance With (IAW) ECAM and the hottest brake approached 380C.  We proceeded back to parking without incident.  The duty officer was contacted after block in and the Ground Turn Back closed with flight coordination.  Maintenance found no issue with the brakes, tires, or fuse plugs and the brakes cooled normally.My improper callout of 'Max power set, no SRS'.  This call caused the captain to reject the takeoff, specifically with regard to the wind shear alerts and his belief that the SRS system was not working.Given the announcement by ATCT of winds shear alerts we utilized the wind shear procedure for takeoff.  That procedure drove our decision to have the PM utilize FPV after TOGA was selected.  The fact that the FPV selection eliminates most displayed information on the FMA of the selected side was unanticipated.  Instead of announcing 'Max Power set, no SRS' I should have crosschecked the captain's display and not fixated on the engine performance gauges while waiting for Max power to be set.  I may have realized that it was in fact a normal indication and not an anomaly.  A better understanding of the FPV setting, its resultant effect on the FMA's, and perhaps the selection of FPV after the 'SRS' call would have prevented this incident.  I have re-read the PHB procedures on Wind shear to ensure this type of circumstance does not result in a future incident.  Admittedly, I was very surprised by the Captain's decision to reject the takeoff, although I believe his decision rested with the possibility of taking an aircraft into the air with known wind shear alerts that potentially did not have a working SRS bar/Wind shear detection system.","","","","An A300 First Officer (FO) reported the Captain initiated a rejected takeoff when the FO announced 'No SRS' at about 105 kts on the takeoff roll.","","",FALSE,FALSE

I agreed, and when I talked to aircraft Y from the southwest, I instructed him to enter a right downwind for runway 17 and report midfield downwind.  Then, I talked to aircraft X from the southeast and instructed him to enter a left downwind for runway 17 and report midfield downwind. Aircraft X made a wide (nonstandard) left downwind outside of runway 21 and reported midfield downwind for runway 17.  At that point, I instructed aircraft X to extend downwind to sequence him behind aircraft Y.  When aircraft Y was no longer a conflict, I instructed aircraft X base turn his discretion and cleared him to land on runway 17. Next, aircraft Z called at the ramp requesting taxi for a northwest departure.  I entered aircraft Z into the ARTS IIE keyboard and taxied him to runway 21 at intersection delta.  Aircraft Z came back and requested a departure from taxiway alpha and charlie and I taxied him as requested.  As aircraft Y was on landing roll, I instructed him to turn left at taxiway hotel and taxi to parking via hotel charlie alpha, hold short of taxiway alpha (for aircraft Z at the intersection).  Aircraft Z called up at charlie and alpha and requested takeoff clearance and I told him to hold position for traffic landing runway 17 on short final (which is where I estimated aircraft X to be).  To confirm aircraft X's position, I scanned runway 17 final, but was unable to locate the aircraft.  Seconds later I located aircraft X and he was on a very short final for closed runway 12. At that moment I issued go around instructions several times to aircraft X but the aircraft was unresponsive and landed on runway 12 which has boneyard airplanes parked on it (with a small open area between the aircraft).  After the aircraft rolled out on closed runway 12, I gave him instructions to taxi to the FBO and asked him to call the tower (but did not give the brasher warning).  All other aircraft landed and departed without incident and no one was injured.  After reporting the incident to management, I was able to listen to the recording and I realized that I had issued go around instructions to 'aircraft a [wrong call sign off by a letter]'  instead of 'aircraft X' but issued two more general go around statements in an attempt to get the aircraft to abandon the landing.The Albuquerque VFR sectional still shows runway 12/30 (which is closed) on the airport icon which could lead an aircraft to believe it is an open runway and should be updated to remove that runway from the icon. Also, the airport should paint larger, brighter, and more frequent closed runway markings on the runway.","","The flight was to deliver an aircraft to an owner in ABQ with a fuel stop in Roswell.

I thought the tower said Runway 27 and I turned to what I thought was Runway 27.  As I descended I wanted to call tower for correct runway verification.  The tower told another aircraft to hold position, another aircraft was on short final, my position.  I knew the tower saw me and the runway I was going to land on. I was prepared to go around, but when the tower told another aircraft to hold, there was another aircraft on short final, I knew the tower saw me and where I was landing.  They said nothing about me making a landing on the wrong runway until after I landed. I realize I made a mistake but I do believe the tower should have warned about my mistake rather than just watching it being made.","","A ROW Controller and pilot report of a landing at ROW on a closed runway.","","",FALSE,FALSE

Around FL240 we had been told to expect the south transition. However, ATC changed us to the north transition and then back again to the south transition based on changing winds at the airport. At FL210, they cleared us for the FRDMM arrival. During this time they then cleared us via the TRUPS. I inquired and that was given in error and we were recleared to descend via the FRDMM arrival. I also inquired on landing runway since the ATIS was giving a different runway than he assigned. He said that the ATIS was giving out the wrong runway ONLY.    I started to notice that the ATIS updates were changing at a rapid pace, consistent with a thunderstorm passing over the field. The first ATIS included a squall line passing. We initially received an ATIS and by the time the events ended we were back [near beginning of the alphabet.] I do not remember being given an altimeter setting from ATC and when we performed the inrange [checklist] I gave the most up-to-date altimeter setting which was 29.54 to the Captain (CA).   As we were approaching PLDGE, the controller told us to immediately stop our descent and to hold at PLDGE. We were less than 5 miles from PLDGE and quickly rushed to put the hold in the FMS. He said expect 1 turn in the hold and to level at 17,000. Also, we were instructed to slow as well. He said all of this was due to flow into DCA. We had started to hold when the controller asked us what altitude we were at. I said 17,000 and he confirmed that this was not what he was showing. I said we were level at 17,000 and current altimeter 29.54. He quickly stated that this was wrong and current altimeter was 30.04. He said he informed us earlier that the ATIS was wrong. The CA and I both agreed that earlier he had told all aircraft on frequency that the runways were wrong and that was it. There was no mention about altimeter. The controller told us we were not listening. Numerous other aircraft were inquiring about runway and altimeter settings.     After one turn we were recleared direct to PLDGE and given a descent to 16,000. As we started to descend he told us again to descend to 16,000 and once there recleared the FRDMM arrival. We had unfortunately took that as a 'descend via' and not a 'cleared via' The controller inquired about our altitude being off and informed us of our error of descend vs cleared. From there the rest of the arrival was uneventful and we asked for correct altimeter settings with each frequency change. Initial threats were the arrival itself and thunderstorms in the area. During the arrival we were given unexpected close holding, speed reduction, and descents that were not on the arrival. ATC also gave us the wrong arrival and switched landing runways 3 times. ATC only informed us that the ATIS included the wrong runway and DID NOT mention that the altimeter settings being produced were wrong. The errors were the two altitude deviations. The second coming from a high stress and workload environment created from the first one. I believe the quick hold, descent, and speed reduction, followed by the constant weather updates and deviating with storms caused us to confuse the descend via and the cleared via clearance at the end of the event. I believe we should have told ATC we were unable for the hold. We were too close to the fix and combined with our altitude and speed reduction our workload was already too high. Especially after dealing with the wrong altimeter setting and confusion. I also think there needs to be clarification if the ATIS is wrong. When we landed in DCA and asked ground if the departure ATIS was correct he informed us that it was a national outage and that they were producing wrong information. I think this was an urgent issue and should have been communicated better with working crews, possibly via a messagefrom dispatch or ATC. When I first inquired about the runway change on arrival, the controller had no idea that it had been changing to begin with. He informed us only that the runway on the ATIS was wrong and nothing else.","","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","","An EMB145 flight crew experienced the digital ATIS altimeter setting anomaly experienced by so many other flight crews on this day. Two altitude deviations occurred. The first due to the altimeter setting and the second when the crew started to descend via when only cleared via the FRDMM3 arrival.

The initial event lasted several minutes, followed by two more less severe events, in total lasting perhaps 15 - 20 min. There were no SIGMETS that we were aware of, weather and windshear (w/s) data on the OFP for that segment (for FL310, we were at FL330) showed no significant w/s (4 or less). FL330 appeared to be 'in the tops' of the existing cloud layer, which showed no significant radar returns or convective activity. The weather radar system(s) appeared to be operating normally, showing appropriate ground returns etc. when cycled through range, pitch and gain settings. The first encounter was very sudden and severe, with little or no warning beyond what had been only light to moderate turbulence at the time. My first thought was that we had clipped the top of a thunderstorm cell, but there was no indication on the radar, and no lightning, hail or other weather phenomena that would indicate the presence of a thunderstorm. Initial pitch up was not extreme, but accompanied by large airspeed and altitude deviations, resulting in intermittent overspeed and stick shaker warnings. This was followed by a roll to the right of approximately 25 degrees and resulted in a 50 - 60 degree heading change and loss of LNAV capture. Observed altitude excursions were approximately +700 feet, to -500 feet from FL330. Airspeed fluctuations were too large and erratic to capture. FO, as PF, initiated recovery by disconnecting A/P and A/T and attempting to limit pitch and roll excursions and stabilize the flight path and airspeed. ATC was notified and did not report any conflict or traffic hazard in our immediate vicinity. We heard no other reports of severe turbulence on frequency, or on 121.5 mHz. There were no TCAS targets displayed nearby. Once brought back to a more stabilized path (perhaps 1 - 2min) the automation was reengaged and we again tried to determine if there were thunderstorms in the area, and again found none. A second encounter soon followed, with less severe flight path excursions, recovered in the same manner. Both events resulted in altitude and course deviations outside of regulatory limits, and were beyond our control.Some factors to consider:1. We were filed for FL310 initially as our T/O was at MGTOW. FL310 was not available from departure, we were offered FL270 or FL330. FL330 was chosen, which was the maximum for our GW. Once level we elected to use LRC over ECON initially in order to 'split the difference' between the amber bands on the airspeed indicator until our GW reduced. 3hrs later we were still in LRC which resulted in a .859m cruising speed when the turbulence was encountered. Mach .82 was entered into VNAV as soon as the automation was re-engaged, followed eventually by ECON for the remainder of the flight.2. Upset training works, FO's quick response and deliberate but smooth recovery, using techniques trained for annually, was directly responsible for the safe outcome, and undamaged aircraft, from this thankfully rare event.3. CRM/captain authority issues. CRM/TEM training works as well. While many would say hand flying in severe turbulence should be a 'captain only' event, I disagree, with certain caveats. As stated, FO was PF, yet with the first sudden encounter I also instinctively reached for the yoke and thrust levers, resulting in both pilots on the controls precisely when the need for smooth inputs is absolutely critical. Keeping that in mind, but remaining prepared, I withdrew my hands from the controls and continued as PM while FO performed the recovery. Clearly there are arguments for either case, but they are also not mutually exclusive, as I remained prepared to switch roles if I thought it was required, which I am glad to report was not the case. Bothpilots were intently focused on all aspects of the flight path, but working as a team and not in a tug of war on the controls. We don't train that way in the simulator, that is: switching roles in the middle of an upset, so we shouldn't be adding a step to the maneuver in the chaos of the real event; it is a bad time to practice a hand off, provided the PF is winning the battle.4. Fatigue/FRM. As can often happen, my rest plans did not result in the amount of sleep intended, though I was in bed in a quiet, dark room during the pre-duty rest period. The departure was late afternoon local, with full daylight for at least the first part of the flight, and we were a 3 man crew so I knew there would be a rest period. Fitness for flight is by nature a subjective call, and while I did feel somewhat tired at pick up time, I judged myself fit for duty. My practice as captain, once the PF/PM/RP duties are established, is to give first choice of rest to the PF, who in this case chose the middle rest period. As I felt sufficiently rested to stay in the seat for the first part of the flight I elected to take the last rest period. After sunset now, at 3hrs in cruise when the event began, I was experiencing some fatigue and probably was not 100% precisely when, at an instant's notice, 150% was required. I would describe this as one factor in the overall equation of this event, with perhaps the worst place for me to have been at that time would be in the bunk.Recommended practices for future events. Preparedness is the key, and planning as much as practical in terms of weather forecasts and flight planning. But, as in our case, where it was almost completely unexpected, proficient hand flying skills are the most important tool to have immediately available. My understanding is that there will be increased emphasis on real time, less scripted, training scenarios. That will likely add realism to promote greater preparedness for such extreme and unexpected events like the one we encountered.","","Approximately 3 hrs into our flight while cruising at FL330 and in Tokyo FIR we suddenly encountered severe turbulence that resulted in the aircraft deviating from assigned altitude and course. Airspeed control was lost and fluctuated rapidly from over speed to stick shaker. Pitch up was not excessive but aircraft did climb rapidly and rolled and skewed violently to the right resulting in a large departure from its previous course. Maybe, 60 degrees of heading and a lateral displacement of some distance. I could not say how far with any accuracy. I disconnected all automation and attempted to recover, very mindful of not exacerbating the situation. Aircraft did not respond well to control inputs but I was able to limit the deviations initially, and then bring it back under control. As we were attempting to bring the aircraft back to course and altitude we re-engaged the automation and a few seconds later we encountered more severe turbulence that resulted in a loss of flight path control for a second, brief time. We recovered the aircraft as before and returned to course and altitude. Altitude deviations were approximately plus 700-800 and minus 500-600, lateral displacement was approximately 2-3 miles. The captain made two radio broadcasts to Tokyo to report our situation, both acknowledged by ATC. At no time prior to this were any significant radar returns seen along our route of flight. The night was dark but the sky was full of stars and no convective activity had been observed or reported. However it did appear that we were flying over a broken layer of cloud and a few of these reached our altitude. FL330 was the maximum altitude for our weight and was selected due to filed level not being available, and, our fuel load being very tight on a re-release flight plan, the alternative FL270 would have been too low. However a careful analysis before departure gave us no reason for concern and we adjusted our cruising speed, selecting LRC, to better match our situation. There were no mechanical issues with the aircraft and the radar when tested had performed as expected. My radar range was set to 80 miles prior to the event but after the first encounter I selected 40 miles and confirmed it was set to display turbulence. The aircraft performed flawlessly prior to and after the event.","","B747 flight crew experiences severe turbulence at FL330 in the Tokyo FIR. Altitude deviations of 600-700 feet occur along with stick shaker and over speed warnings. The First Officer disconnects the autopilot and auto thrust to return the aircraft to stable flight.

We continued the ILS 6 with no further issues and landed safely at TEB. The reason the deviation occurred was due to a break down in CRM.

Crew scheduling sent me to the airport in a limo.  I left my domicile late afternoon for a 3 hour drive.  Enroute I advised dispatch at 30 minutes from the airport via cell phone to make sure the aircraft had been serviced (lav, potable water, cleaned) and that a start cart be retrieved as the APU was on deferral.  I arrived at the airport with an anxious charter representative greeting me and saying they had been advised to rush to the airport only to find out that flight was not crewed yet.  They waited on me for over 3 hours.  Needless to say, the passengers were not happy.Of course nothing was done, not even a release was sent to the FBO.  The aircraft was trashed.  It had not been fueled, lav's overflowing, and no potable water.  In addition to this, for the first time I was advised by crew scheduling that the First Officer (FO) was flying in from somewhere else.  Of course, this was done only when I inquired with the Flight Attendants (FA)s on the whereabouts of the First Officer.I get everything done, the First Officer arrives an hour later and we board.  Our filed destination was calling for -FZ DR, 1 sm visibility, and 500 feet overcast.  I did have an alternate and had 20,000 lbs of fuel on board and was very comfortable with the release.   I briefed the FO, he did his preflight, and we taxied out and departed.At about 20 minutes from arrival we picked up the ATIS and it is broadcasting FZ RA and 1sm visibility and ceiling 400 feet.  We begin descent and then we receive an ACARS from Dispatch informing us that the FBO will not take our aircraft and to standby for Alternate.  I have an alternate on the release and this is when we find out that the alternate cannot handle our aircraft.  (What?  Why wasn't that found out before we took off?)  That airport was never a good alternate for planning purposes.  We are now flying around in FZ RA (the most hazardous form of icing for ANY aircraft).  I began discussing with the FO on possible alternates and suggesting....dispatch agrees....we get cleared and then dispatch comes back and says we cannot go there (this happened at least 3 times).  Then, knowing we cannot hang out in those weather conditions any longer I request a nearby small airport ZZZ, since I know we service.  Dispatch agrees, we get cleared to ZZZ and then when almost there dispatch sends ACARS saying that 'Our alternate cannot rally the troops and we cannot go there.'  By now, not knowing how much ice had accumulated and assessing fuel situation, my FO and I decide we need to land in ZZZ and decide what we need to do on the ground.  I inform dispatch and they agree to our plan.We land at approximately shortly before midnight in ZZZ.  There are no services available and we have no APU.  I called Dispatch to discuss a plan.  That's when I am advised of the icing situation at our originally filed destination and that the FBO will not take our aircraft because they have over an inch of ice on the ramp and taxiways and cannot maneuver their equipment.  Dispatch's new plan is to fly back to our domicile where the Midwest was experiencing a snow storm.  Low visibility and ceilings and not even knowing if we can get in I say that is not a good plan. I suggest hotels and transportation to get these customers to a hotel.After about 2 hours, and still stuck on the plane, dispatch said they cannot help them and they do not know what to tell me.  They say that the customers need to call a broker and find their own accommodations.  Obviously, this was not a good thing to tell your customers who were stuck on the plane.  Finally, five hours after we landed they found their own accommodations and even offered to take care of me and my crew with rooms. The team's Coach said to me, 'come with we will take care of you.  Don't you feel like your company totally abandoned you tonight?'  I was tired, embarrassed and completely humiliated at this point.  Finally, over 6 hours since landing in ZZZ, our transportation arrived and took us to a hotel.We showed 10 hours later to fly them to the departure airport.  I stayed in constant contact with the Coach the next day as he was unsure of our company being able to perform at this point.  We flew them back to their destination on Sunday night.  Once the customers deplaned, the second shift lead supervisor at [the FBO] wanted to talk with me.  He asked if I was the Captain last night and I said yes.  He informed me that he contacted our Dispatch before I ever departed for our filed destination the night before informing them that the icing was significant and that a Boeing 737 had landed and reported the braking action as 'NIL' and that there was over inch of ice covering all taxiways, ramps, and runways and that they could not receive our aircraft that night.  We are not authorized to land at an airport with braking action reported as 'NIL'.  Not to mention, freezing rain is the most hazardous icing condition to aircraft and the fact that our flight operations knew this before we dispatched really disturbed me.  In addition to this, an alternate was listed on our release that was an airport that could not receive us anyway so that made it an 'unacceptable alternate'.  My position is that if I would have known about this situation, I would not have departed but this information was withheld from me.  I trust our flight operations to do their job and provide me with pertinent information in regards to the 'safety of flight' and they failed on this evening.  My passengers, my crew, my aircraft, as well as my own safety was jeopardized on this day.  The operation should have been shut down in before we left on the first charter leg.  We could have accommodated everyone and would have gotten this team home on Sunday morning instead of Sunday night and my crew would not have had to spend the night in an airplane with no heat.I followed up with a phone call to Director of Flight Operations about 7-10 days after this happened.  I told him I would be filing a report and assumed he would look into and follow up.  I have heard nothing.On this particular night, operational control was lost and I feel that anyone who had knowledge of this event should have followed up to understand how something like this could have happened.  I gave it time and to this date I have heard nothing from Flight Operations.  If it is accurate that our Dispatch had knowledge that the weather conditions in our originally filed destination had deteriorated and that braking action was reported as 'NIL' by a Boeing 737 prior to our flight's Departure, then this flight should have been canceled before we left.  In addition to this, the original alternate should not have been used for planning purposes if we could not have safely diverted to that airport.  Since we (crew) found out airborne that the filed alternate would not receive our aircraft because of inadequate equipment, it's obvious that no one from flight operations verified that destination would be a good alternate before planning as such.  We service our alternate's airport so I as Pilot In Command (PIC) thought was good alternate and the weather that I had in my hand was adequate.  Also, the weather packet I had attached to the release was adequate to dispatch for our original destination at the time of departure.  Pertinent information (such as a significant weather change from forecast) should always be relayed to flight crews as some as practical.","","","","An ERJ-190 Captain describes the event surrounding his charter flight being illegally dispatched to an airport with NIL braking and freezing drizzle, then diverting to a third airport because the alternate was not suitable.","400, 500","400",FALSE,FALSE

Shortly after being switched over to the final approach controller, we heard a flight execute a missed approach and list the reason as being an unstable approach.  The winds at the time were reported in the ATIS as 220@20G31.  We briefed the go around callouts and procedure at this point, as it sounded like a go around might be likely.  At the time no windshear was being reported in the ATIS.  Due to the wind gusts and Stall Protection Ice Speeds from a prior icing encounter, our Vapp was 150 knots.We were cleared for the River Visual Approach to runway 19.  Although we experienced light to moderate turbulence all the way down the approach, the approach was stable to 500 foot callout, where we were at Vapp and the callout was a 700 fpm descent.  Shortly after completing the last turn and lining up on the centerline of the runway (at about 300-400 feet), we experienced moderate turbulence accompanied by a shift in the wind, resulting in the GPWS callouts of 'Sink Rate . . .  PULL UP PULL UP'.  I was looking outside as the GPWS callouts came, and it didn't appear that the approach had become unstable, but I initiated a Go Around anyway.  A second or two after initiating the Go Around, the GPWS annunciated 'CAUTION WINDSHEAR!'  A few seconds later, with increasing performance from the shear, the aircraft exceeded Vfe for Flaps 5, which the first officer had yet to change.  We went beyond the red line on the airspeed tape for just a couple seconds and no more than about five knots over the limitation.  As we cleaned up the aircraft in the climb, we complied with an ATC assigned heading and altitude of 4,000.  When asked the reason for the go around we said that we encountered windshear. Once at altitude and handed off to another frequency we learned that the airport was switching from a Southbound operation to a Northbound operation, using runway 1 and 33.  We suspect that we were the last aircraft to do an approach to 19.  Even while up at 4,000 feet on the downwind for our second approach, we experienced a loss and gain of 30 knots.  We were eventually cleared for the Mt. Vernon visual to 33.  At about 1,000 feet during our approach we again encountered the 'CAUTION WINDSHEAR!' GPWS alert.  The gusts and shear were not as bad and we were able to make an otherwise uneventful approach and landing.Upon arriving at the gate, I wrote up the flap limitation exceedance and called maintenance.  We swapped aircraft and found that the crew of our new aircraft had experienced the same situation, and also exceeded the flap limitation in a gust.When we began our first approach, the tower was reporting winds from 210-220 degrees.  At the time of our second approach they were reporting winds between 340 and 360 degrees.  I believe our first approach was being made while the winds were in the process of shifting to the North.I think for the most part the First Officer and I did everything we could with the situation we were given.  With our approach speed of 150 knots and Flaps 5 limitation of 180 knots, there wasn't much margin for error during the go around, and the complication of a windshear encounter didn't help.In a situation like this I need to speak much louder to be heard over the GPWS callouts.  They seemed almost continuous as we were initiating the go around, and the First Officer wasn't able to hear my callouts for the go around procedure very well, which may have contributed to a slight delay in cleaning up the aircraft.","","We were cleared for the river visual runway 19 into KDCA. The winds were reported to be 220 @ 20G31. We used stall protection ice speeds (due to icing we received in the decent) and then added the gust factor making our VAP approx 148. As we were being vectored for the approach we heard a plane go around due to 'not being in a position to land'. During the approach briefing the captain did brief a go around. There was light to moderate turbulence throughout the decent and approach. We were stabilized at 500 feet. As we made the turn to final at approx 500-400 feet the wind shifted and we heard the 'SINK RATE' aural caution message. The captain initiated a Go around at approximately 300 feet. Almost immediately after initiating the Go around we the received the WIND SHEAR ALERT message. The wind shear increased the aircrafts performance and airspeed. The sudden increase in airspeed caused the plane to exceed the flaps 5 speed limitation for approximately 3-5 seconds. The captain pitched further up to lower the planes airspeed and we then began retracting the flaps per the Go around SOP. We complied with ATC instructions to reenter the downwind for 19 and climb to 4,000 feet. We informed ATC that we had gone around due to wind shear at 300 feet. The captain informed the passengers of the situation and that we would be coming back in to land. As we turned downwind for runway 19, DCA switched runways to runway 1 due to the wind shifting from the south to the north. We received vectors from ATC for the Mount Vernon Visual runway 1. As we circled to land on runway 33 we received another Windshear alert message. We landed without any further incident. At the gate the captain made a Maintenance logbook entry and informed Maintenance. I am not 100% sure how this event could be prevented in the future. We knew it was going be very windy below the cloud deck and we did brief the go around procedure during the approach briefing. There was no LLWS advisory or Wind shift report in the METAR.The go around happened so quickly and the wind shear alert so soon after we initiated the go around I am unsure how we could have prevented the flap overspeed. I think even if we landed with flaps full to lower the Vap we would have exceed the flap full speed limitation when we received wind shear in the go around. As the pilot monitoring I believe that that the captain flying did a good job during the go around and recovery from the wind shear / flap overspeed.","","An EMB170 Flight Crew experiences a wind shear event during the River Visual approach to Runway 19 at DCA.

It was intended as a quick, easy flight.Warning signs about the day manifested itself with a call. The WX briefer mentioned that there was an AIRMET for moderate turbulence below 8,000 as well as an urgent PIREP for low level wind shear at an airport about 30 NM away. Winds at North Central (SFZ) were 33014G21KT. These were right down one of our two runways, and I was seeking out more challenging conditions to push my personal minimums.The line worker told me 'good luck with those winds' as she was fueling my airplane. I told her that they were right down the runway and she agreed with a 'yeah, I guess so. I guess you should be okay.'After preflight and taxi, I started my run-up. I noticed that the plane was really getting buffeted on the ground by the winds and I thought to myself, 'this is rather windy.' I considered turning around but told myself that I came this far and I may as well fly, with the stipulation that if I felt uncomfortable while airborne I would return immediately. I finished my run-up and took off.I climbed to about 2,000 feet or so and was on my way to the Putnam VOR. Almost immediately after passing 1,000 feet I started to experience moderate turbulence. Shortly after the plane banked 30 degrees to the left in under a second without me changing any flight controls. I decided to abort my flight immediately.A 180 degree set me up for a 45 entry to 33. Due to the winds the plane was essentially ground-tracking sideways. The sensation was that of not flying forward but instead to the side with a massive crab. This spooked me, and this is where my questionable aeronautical decision making of taking off turning into a poor decision. My base for 33 was so unusual and I was feeling so uncomfortable with the situation that I decided to climb and join the pattern for the longer, wider runway 23. At this point, I both consciously and subconsciously just wanted to get on the ground. I was finding myself in somewhat unusual attitudes while fighting to maintain altitude, and the AWOS was now reporting winds variable between 270 and 350 13G27... a 15 knot gust factor with unpredictable winds. An experienced professional pilot may have had no problems with this, but I am not that pilot. I was determined to get on the ground but also scared. What I should have done was abort the approach to 33, overfly the field on the upwind, and reenter the pattern and try again. Instead, I decided to switch to the wider, 'safer' runway. Instead of having a gusty, wind-shear-prone approach with winds right down the runway, they were now giving me a direct crosswind with all the same wind-related problems. Keep in mind that my Skyhawk has a max demonstrated crosswind component of 15 knots; I was now becoming the proverbial 'test pilot'.Predictably, my approach was very poor. Approach speed in my 172 is 75MPH with flaps up and 70MPH with flaps down; I was approaching with 100MPH with 10 degrees in. I knew this as well and instead of going around, I said to myself 'I have 7,000 feet(!) of runway; I will float down the runway for a considerable period of time so let it float and it'll come down when it's ready.' There are two problems with this line of reasoning: I didn't have 7,000 feet, I had 5,000, and that crosswind had a slight tailwind component to it as well. As predicted, I floated for what seemed like a very long time. Finally, the wheels came down, but I started porpoising. I let it bounce a few times, hoping to let it settle, but the end of the runway was fast approaching. After four bounces I executed a sloppy go-around in which I forgot to turn off the carb heat. There's a church that we are supposed to use as a noise abatement landmark that indicates we can make turns at 1,450 feet MSL... I was at 750 feet MSL by the time I was over the church. The airport altitude is around 50 MSL.Thankfully, my trainingregarding avoiding power-on stalls and spins by not pitching up aggressively and utilizing heavy right rudder on takeoff prevented me from making a poor situation even worse. After gaining my composure I set up for a base entry to runway 33, like I should have in the first place. I was able to set up a respectable approach to 33, landed the airplane, and put in an urgent PIREP very shortly after tying down.I am very fortunate to be able to submit this report right now. I ventured forth into conditions that I thought I could handle and those conditions turned out to be beyond what I can handle at this stage in my private aviation career. I made a series of poor decisions regarding bad Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM), specifically go/no-go, subpar runway selection and sloppy go-around technique that could have very easily bent metal or worse, ended up with me killing myself. This all happened within the span of 30 minutes. I intend on talking with an instructor regarding this experience and to fix my go-around technique, and hopefully I will avoid situations like this in the future.","","","","A C172 pilot reported having difficulty dealing with gusty wind conditions.","750, 1000, 1450, 2000, 7000","7000",FALSE,FALSE

Two minutes later, I receive a response that said, 'we need you to go to LBB because we have too many aircraft at AUS'. I'm at bingo fuel with no information on LBB. I changed the plan with ATC and headed for LBB. During descent, 5 feet of ACARS paper printed out detailing the NOTAMS and weather at LBB. The weather turned to moderate chop/turbulence as we descended into developing convective weather between us and LBB. On approach we realized that runway 35 was shortened and requested Runway 8/26. Winds were 060/15 G 25 knots. An [aircraft] went around for wind shear on Runway 35. We requested and received RNAV Runway 8 approach. The entire descent/approach was flown in the 'YELLOW' as my experienced First Officer (FO) and I worked independently to digest rapidly changing weather, wind shear warnings, and an unfamiliar airport. I flew and talked to ATC while he did everything else. LBB approach basically briefed me on the airport conditions because there was no time to digest the ACARS info before LBB became unsuitable for landing due to deteriorating weather. Fortunately, no altitude busts or deviations occurred.  Once on the ground, dispatch continued to push for a minimum fuel launch and return to [the original destination]. My conversations with him included him saying, 'You must get airborne or you will lose your release time!' All the while ATC had a ground stop in place for DFW extending 2 hours into the future. I insisted on 2,000 pounds of extra fuel over his protests. We ended up sitting in LBB for 3.5 hours waiting for the ground stop to lift. This became a nightmare divert and there was no reason for it. I should have gone to AUS, which was the plan right up to the divert point. The dispatcher was reacting rather than thinking ahead and I allowed him to put me in a dangerous position. That will not happen again. If dispatch puts out 100 flight plans with AUS as an alternate, then they should plan to have 100 aircraft at AUS. I will go where I think it is safest.My confidence in in this company's dispatch has been badly damaged by this event. Am I getting accurate information? Why is the dispatch plan diametrically opposed to the ATC plan? Do they talk to each other? Who is pushing this dispatcher? We will hurt someone if this type of operation continues.I don't know what to fix here because I don't know what is going on in Dispatch during these weather events. From my end, I will not react to a changing plan from Dispatch when I know my original plan will work.","","","","An aircraft dispatched to DFW with an AUS alternate was diverted to LBB by Dispatch and had to contend with thunderstorms on arrival. The Captain will go the filed alternate next time with better known weather.","","",FALSE,FALSE

We reduced airspeed to hold speed per FMS and Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) cards. Both pilots witnessed airspeed slowing below target speed and entered into a conversation about appropriate action. Holding leg length was increased from 10 to 15 mile legs in an attempt to reduce AOA and build speed. Throttle was set to Takeoff Go around (TOGA) power and then max power. Airspeed continued to deteriorate and First Officer (FO) requested a lower altitude. ATC advised unable. Airspeed continued to drop and we requested lower again, eventually having to make the decision to [notify ATC] and descend. Radio coverage in the area was poor, perhaps due to the weather, and ATC was unclear of our intentions/actions. We started a descent to FL370 and then got the stick shaker. At that point we made the decision to treat the event as a full blown stall and chose to continue to FL360 for airspeed, following stall recovery profile. After informing ATC of our need to descend numerous times, ATC was still confused or unaware of our intentions. The root cause of the event was an inability of the aircraft to maintain airspeed at 38,000 feet. Further complications resulted from congested airspace and poor radio coverage. To avoid this type of event in the future, holding at 38,000 feet would be avoided!","","The root cause of the event was the high altitude holding clearance with a relatively low minimum holding speed combined with turbulent air. The root of the perceived altitude deviation was the lack of clear communication with air traffic control, most likely due to the static interference from the nearby storms.","","CRJ-700 flight crew reported they were unable to maintain speed in a holding pattern at FL380 and advised ATC they had no choice but to descend to a lower altitude.","36000, 37000, 38000","38000",TRUE,TRUE

I did check the radar several times before departure and it was one of those days with thunderstorms building everywhere. Around Texas they were fairly scattered at the time and I was more worried about a huge line of storms between Missouri and Chicago. We were on route and had the radar on watching these scattered storms around Laredo, Texas. We did a slow climb the last 1,000 feet to level off at FL390 which was roughly about 1,000 feet above the clouds. After about 2 minutes of level off and at .74 we were approximately 20 miles between each cell with absolutely nothing on the radar in between and in the clear. Then without warning we hit severe turbulence. The First Officer was the one flying at the time and the autopilot kicked off. For a few seconds I let him fly but since he is fairly new I decided to take the controls. The plane was drastically changing altitude of +[/]-1,000-2,000 feet and airspeed changes of +-50 knots approximately. At this point I told the First Officer (FO) to tell ATC we are going down to FL350 and I just tried to keep the attitude indicator somewhat centered as the whole plane was all over. Within this time of about 1-2 minutes (approximately) we did momentarily get the stick shaker I think twice but each time the airspeed would drastically shoot back up but I still did decide to go max power. Even with the descent to FL350 the turbulence did not get better for a while. As soon as we were out of the severe I had the FO call the FA's and ask how they were and to remain seated for now. At the time they were up and they sat on passengers laps and they all worked to hold the cart and everything down. Luckily no one was injured. I then also talked to both dispatch and maintenance to give them a heads up. I feel like I'm a conservative pilot around thunderstorms and especially as a newer captain. In my almost 10 years with the airlines I have experienced a lot and with the information through our radar I honestly feel like we were far enough from these cells and I have never experienced turbulence even close to this and hopefully never again. After this event I kept replaying everything in my head and thinking about what I could have done differently or better. With the information that we had I feel there's nothing I could have done differently unless it was to return to Mexico. From our radar we chose the most conservative path through these scattered thunderstorms. There were no reports from ATC since this is not a busy airspace on the Mexico border and these storms were building fast. I do wish that if dispatch had tools to give us a huge diversion around these cells that could have been a better outcome. Also, with fast changing technology this event may have been avoided if through a tablet and onboard Wi-Fi we could have looked at ground based radar to get the 'bigger picture' of what was happening.","","","","CRJ-700 Captain reported encountering severe turbulence on a flight from an airport in Mexico to ORD.","1000, 2000, 35000, 39000","1000",TRUE,FALSE

The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying. I called dispatch on Satcom enroute to get an update on weather on our route. The dispatcher mentioned a small speck of weather on the Sat IR approximately 150 miles ahead on our position. We already were looking at that on our radar and started a deviation to the west of course with ATC clearance about 80 miles away.Our current altitude was 39,000, the optimum altitude was 37,900. We were 1,000 above optimum but also 2,900 below Max (41,900). We had selected that altitude as the ride was not good at 35,000 and we were unable to get 37,000 approved earlier.The Weather was on the route at OPLIP intersection, and our Deviation was west of course 60 NM. Time was XA:40Z and we were talking with Amazonica Control. As we approached the cell (still approx. 40 miles off our left) the FO deviated even further to the west to give a wider berth. With the turbulence we had slowed to mach 82. We were about 20 knots above the yellow hook. VNAV was engaged and rather abruptly we both noticed a change in wind direction from a right cross wind of 30 to a headwind of 25. I noticed a sudden change in Total Air Temperature (TAT) temp warmer and then the Pitch Limit Indicators (PLI) displayed on the PFD about 1.5 degrees above our pitch attitude and the speed was decreasing, still above the yellow hook. Engine thrust was now at max Climb we both knew that we would not be able to maintain altitude. The FO asked me about a descent, I said yes descend immediately.I called once to ATC for a clearance and got no reply to our request. I declared a mayday and broadcast our intention to descend to 370. The FO selected 370 and pushed the altitude select button and turned the jet even further from the cell. I suggested a vertical speed descent rather than VNAV.I scanned the engine instruments and EICAS on the descent I notice the temp had gone from -18 to -3. Almost as quickly as we had lost speed in the descent we gained it, and quickly approached max airspeed or the red tape. The FO had his hands full selecting the heading sector and pulling the throttles back some. I used the speed brakes to aid the descent and control speed, after some variable movements in speed from the high to low (all still within the yellow and red bands) we leveled off and maintained 370.I explained our reason for the Mayday call to Amazonica control and got clearance to maintain 370. After passing the weather we were in the clear and returned to the track.We surmised that the temp change put the airplane in a coffin corner situation suddenly and once we got slightly behind the power curve, the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude.I've seen sudden changes in wind speed and direction around thunderstorms and also temps changes, but this was the most significant temp change I've witnessed. We gave this rapidly developing cell (with significant lightning during our passage) at least 20 miles clearance at all times and choose to fly upwind of the cell. But even that was not enough to avoid these atmospheric circumstances prompting our Mayday descent. The Mayday call was to warn ATC and other aircraft of the immediate situation, the outcome of which was never in doubt. [The other] FO was in the bunk and was briefed on the event after our crew change a short period later.Dispatch needs better weather tools for Thunderstorms in Latin South America. They often look at weather and think that not much weather exists and can offer no help to crews in real time. Often causing us to deviate far off course to avoid developing thunderstorms, such as this weather event. Also inflight weather charts and Radar for flight crews in a must in this modern era. Most GA aircraft have much better real time pics of the weather than a $300 M airline aircraft, using hours old paper charts and old electronic data from prior to block out! It's time for real time weather in our flight decks!","","[Report Narrative Contained No Additional Information].","","A B777 flight crew encounters turbulence at FL390 approaching a thunderstorm over South America.

Upon initial climb out we enter IMC associated with multiple embedded thunderstorms and local convective activity. While climbing to cruise we encounter chop and light turbulence along with heavy precipitation. Multiple lightning strikes occur in close proximity along with some evidence of heavy static discharge. While climbing through precipitation and receiving vectors to avoid weather, we experience difficult communication issues with various departure and ARTCC controllers. Several aircraft as well as controller communication and transmitter changes were required to maintain contact with ATC. Due to heavy line and storm locations we elected to try to stay on a westerly course until an open area presented itself and we could traverse southerly and continue enroute to ZZZZ. While finding a vacant area of convective radar returns we elected to climb from FL320 to FL360 and proceed on a more southbound route. Shortly after leveling off and additional vectors, an IAS flag on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) indicating a difference in air data was presented. After short discussion about the indication, including the Captain's (pilot flying) recent simulation training, we find ourselves heading through a section of weather that appears to be closing in on us and our planned route through. While this is simultaneously happening both First Officer and Captain side airspeed indications begin to deteriorate. The rate and somewhat erratic change causes us to refer immediately to the erroneous airspeed tables listed in the QRH. These prompted the Captain to take the autopilot off along with disabling the flight director and yaw damper and hand fly the appropriate attitude and power settings being called out by myself (pilot monitoring), as prescribed in the QRH. During the next moments the air data (both my First Officer side and the Captain side) was showing all red Xs. Now with our planned route being closed off, turbulence increasing and workload increasing, the immediate action to return was initially made. ATC was advised along with notification of air data indications and problems. As we begin our turn back, we receive word from ATC that the route back is deteriorating as well. The Captain maintained aircraft control and I began work on notification of dispatch, alternate destination weather, and more QRH reference to aircraft control. The decision to divert to SAT was made. The location and weather was most favorable to us. We also knew we had several other options regarding customs and operations capabilities at SAT versus trying to get to a weather entrenched alternate. As we began a turn and descend we encountered more moderate turbulence, aircraft icing, as well as a loud pop and ozone/burning smell, most likely indicating a lightning strike. Throughout the descent the Captain side at times began to regain some data and then fail again, while my side was relatively void of information regarding air data. We coordinated with ATC to help call out our ground speed and their altitude in order to cross reference ours that was intermittent and maintain positive control. As we prepared for an approach to Runway 4 at SAT, we broke out and into intermittent IMC at about 6,000 feet. During some vectors around more weather into SAT the Captain side began to slowly regain air data. My side was a little more delayed and eventually returned closer to landing. Once on final the pilot flying was able to get a visual on Runway 4 and an overweight landing was made. We taxied under our own power to the terminal where flight termination was made.Threats included in this event are numerous and at times quite compounding. Adverse weather, ATC communication during weather, aircraft malfunction, stress of situation, and distractions based on all outside in influences. Errors included procedural errors based around QRH usage. I originally read the pitch and power settings and based it on the incorrect ERJ model. I did remedy this during descent once I found out I was reading the wrong ones a few pages before. Operational decision errors may have been related to proceeding farther into the storm system then we should have. The decision to divert or even avoid the weather at a greater distance may have kept us from going through the weather cell during descent that was quite rough.It seems especially with some of the foreign flying that we do, our weather gathering or even flight planning might be lacking. Of course our major threat related error was related to an aircraft malfunction, but the multitude of factors and chain of events that led to the subsequent diversion and landing may have been less likely had weather planning been improved or possibly even avoided if the flight was routed better.","","","","An EMB-145 First Officer describes a flight in convective weather with several lightning strikes.

Departure [occurred] without issue, and into a normal climb to 7,500 feet MSL due West towards the coastline to avoid mountainous terrain to the North.

Without certainty but believed to be in the vicinity near the edge of the Class E airspace, climbing through approximately 4,500 feet MSL: as we were climbing Westbound, a single engine, low-wing aircraft heading approximately South-Eastbound crossed above and convergent with our flight-path. Closest distance is believed to be approximately 300 feet. Our landing light was on as well as our strobe light, the other aircraft did not appear to have any lights visible. We were monitoring but not in communication Approach. Factors that contributed were the nature of this airspace being very congested and busy, but we were aware so were heads up and looking for traffic (pilot and passenger). The nature of this airspace has aircraft ascending and descending concurrently, increasing the chances for converging aircraft. Passenger was first to notice the traffic so having two people looking probably helped the situation. Upon identification of the traffic, the passenger notified the pilot immediately and it was determined that no action was required to avoid collision. Not being in communication with the relevant ATC may have contributed as they may have notified both airplanes of our mutual proximity and closing paths. Landing and/or strobe lights may have also helped in seeing the traffic sooner. The other aircraft appeared to be in a slow descent, so may not have had adequate forward visibility to see our aircraft. Following the airway would have had us on a similar flight path so may not have helped, if we'd been using that airway. Using a VFR Flight Plan may have helped in notifying the local ATC facilities of our intention to use the airspace, but that information may have been too course to allow for the fine separation needed in this situation. Though the weather reporting stations South [departure airport] do not indicate clouds, clouds (approximately FEW coverage) were located above the mountainous terrain to the North.

Very shortly after that we exited precipitation. All indications returned to normal. First Officer instruments all started working normally. Autopilot and autothrottle engaged normally. We were on arrival at that point and continued uneventfully to our filed destination. The altitude deviation was about 400 feet before the Captain was able to get ahold of ATC and tell them we were descending. ATC was fine with that and cleared us to FL310. They didn't question the deviation at all. No emergency was declared but we would have with our next transmission if ATC didn't want us to descend.I don't know what Maintenance was able to find wrong with the plane, if anything. We suspect an icing event of some sort.  Things I could have done better. When transitioning to hand flying cross check power settings more often. Throttle position felt normal and performance indications looked normal on my side. I suspect that when the autothrottle disconnected the power was slightly low due to turbulence deviations and since the performance looked ok on my side I didn't notice it was low. When in icing it would be a good idea to cross check standby and Captain's instruments as well. Pilot not flying can't stop monitoring aircraft performance when troubleshooting either. As usual in an incident/accident chain there are a lot of things that lead up to it. This included deviations due to storms, moderate turbulence, IMC, very abnormal aircraft malfunctions affecting the pilot flying instruments only and static on radios hindering communication and adding another distraction.","The reporter stated that Maintenance found no system anomalies to explain this event. Other long time MD-80 pilots had never experience this type of event either and this reporter is guessing that the pitot system was unable to prevent ice buildup and therefore affect the central air data computer systems.","There were never any fail flags in the flight instruments. We were not sure if the airspeed readings were caused by the data fail messages. At FL310 the turbulence lessened and all fail indications went away.","","A MD-83 CADC DATA 1, CADC DATA 2 and MACH TRIM COMPENSATOR Fail lights alerted at the same time the autothrottles disconnected and the ENGINE ANTI-ICE VALVE alerted. The radar was not painting weather but ice was accumulating on the window.

At 1,000 feet he asked the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to display the Environmental Control System (ECS) page on the lower EICAS and noticed the left outflow valve was fully open. The aircraft was pressurizing at an excessive rate, so he ran the QRH procedure and tried to manually control the pressurization system but the left side was unresponsive, the right side worked on the manual mode and was able to control the pressurization at that time. During level flight we had an EICAS msg. 'Cabin Alt Auto' so we ran the QRH and complied with QRH instructions and were able to control the cabin pressurization manually. During cruise Left outflow valve would display full open, and full close indications in manual and in Auto. This was confirmed by mechanic who was onboard. The mechanic tried to troubleshoot by opening Central Monitoring Computer (CMC) on the center CDU. CMC confirmed multiple failures of the pressurization system involving both channels of pressurization system and the failure of the left outflow valve. Status messages Cabin Alt Auto B, and Cabin Alt Auto A were displayed on status page. During cruise, cabin altitude would periodically initiate excessive rates of climb for no apparent reason. Cabin was stabilized and in Manual mode, and would have to be stabilized manually. We had to be completely dedicated to monitoring the system to maintain a constant cabin altitude and differential pressure. This task was very consuming in addition to normal flight duties and other distractions, ACARS/ SATCOM failure, HF communications, redispatch flight plan, and weather avoidance. The relief pilot had flown this aircraft a week prior with the left outflow was ON MEL. He briefed the crew about it. We looked at the history of this airplane and found multiple write ups about it. The Pressurization system had been written up numerous times, and was never properly repaired.  This situation led to a complete loss of pressurization automatic control.  Manually controlling pressurization on a seven hour leg was a big distractor and a safety issue.

The time of this is approximate. We were level at FL180 deviating around storm cells in IMC. We encountered moderate to severe turbulence for about 15 seconds and lost all navigation and radios. Our only communication with Center was the transponder that was still working. Unable to get the navigation or radios back in operation we squawked 7600. We broke out into clear weather and decided to descend in VMC down to 3000 feet and look for a suitable airport. We landed at [an airport] and called Center by phone.After shutting down the engines and then turning the Battery Switch back on to trouble shoot this problem all navigation and radios came back on and operated normal.We did a preflight and departed VFR, called Center for VFR flight following to San Marcos (HYI).","","On IFR flight plan to HYI (San Marcos, TX) first officer flying, we passed between two buildups. There was a smaller one between the buildups. I thought we would pass over it but we just clipped the top and hit two severe bumps about four seconds apart. Only two and then smooth ride. We then noticed both Garmins (530 & 430) were totally blank. Now we had no navigation and no communication. We recycled avionics and inverters to no avail. We discussed problem and squawked 7600 (lost communications). We were on border between FTW and HOU Center. Don't recall which we were talking to at the time of lost navigation/communication event. I realized we could not navigate accurately and decided we should get on ground before became a hazard to other traffic. I commanded the copilot who was flying to descend to 3,500 MSL so we could find a landing place as soon as possible. We were VMC after the turbulence. After about 10 or 15 minutes we spotted a paved, single runway airport and landed there.After parking and shutdown a man from the small FBO approached us with a phone [number] and name to call. I called, and I explained the situation and he seemed satisfied. Short conversation. We got back in, started up, powered up avionics and all started and worked well. We flew VFR with flight following to HYI. No problems.Next day I mentioned the situation to an avionics shop and learned there is a 5G switch in the Garmins. That was what shut us down. He said we could have totally powered down (batt and gens) and recycled to get Garmins working again. We could have done that in air. Learned something. Also, I will not ever try to hop over a buildup even if a small one. They are rough. They come up faster than you think. Even in smooth air.","","Citation flight crew experiences moderate to severe turbulence at FL180 for 15 seconds that apparently causes both Garmins to shut down.

Once clear of that heaviest area, I turned back north direct ZZZ1, and from ZZZ1 turned direct ZZZ2.  I had been in and out of the bottom of the ceiling at 9,000 MSL, no ice and mostly smooth.   Near ZZZ1 I started to encounter a lot more turbulence and entered solid IMC, in snow and clouds but still no icing.  I was keeping an eye outside to watch in case I needed to ask for lower if evidence of icing began.  ATC called and asked me to maintain 9,000 and repeated the altimeter setting, and I scanned and saw that I was descending through 8,600 MSL, and that the AP had turned off, probably due to the turbulence.  It does have an alarm when this happens but I did not hear it.  At that point I raised the nose to climb back to 9,000, but when I looked over at the Airspeed Indicator (ASI), it was dropping rapidly below 80 knots.  Not wanting to stall in IMC, I lowered the nose substantially.  At this point my scan was uneven and not making sense. I have read a lot of accounts of pilots who are rapidly overcome in situations like this. At that point I decided that the safest course of action would be to continue to descend rapidly to what I knew was warm VMC below me.  I lowered my landing gear, started a rapid descent to around 4,000 MSL, where I broke out of the snow and clouds and could reorient myself.  ATC advised me of closest local airports and asked about assistance, I asked them to stand by.  Once I was back in control and everything was looking normal, I flew on for a while, and continued on to my destination at 7,000 MSL, which from that point would keep me in VMC.  ATC asked me about the nature of the problem and I told them that I lost my AP in IMC and had loss of control.It is clear in hindsight that the reason I was seeing the drop in the ASI was that the pitot was being plugged with ice or snow or water.  I should have had the pitot heat on but did not.  The rest of the instruments could have shown me that, if my scan had been good, but I was only intermittently scanning while the AP was flying in cruise.  While my reaction was certainly a way to stay safe, it may have been an overreaction.   However, I was tired after a long day and knew I was not at my best, and I wanted to get somewhere safe quickly.  I was far from any busy airspace, and [advising ATC] and descending did not cause a scramble to move other aircraft, as far as I know.","","","","A BE36 pilot reports encountering snow and turbulence at 9,000 feet causing an autopilot disconnect that is not noticed. ATC does notice and a climb back to 9,000 is initiated before very low airspeed is detected. A rapid descent to 4,000 feet is initiated and ATC is advised. Lack of pitot heat was the likely cause of the low airspeed indication and the flight is able to continue to destination.","9000","9000",TRUE,TRUE

I was given a descent to 2500 feet and was approximately 15-20 minutes out. This put me in IMC so I lost the ability to see weather in front of me. ASOS at MKL reported a ceiling of 1900 overcast and I think wind of 3 knots at 190. I discussed this with Memphis Center and decided on the visual approach to Runway 20 at MKL. I rechecked the weather some minutes later and the new ASOS had a ceiling of 900 feet with light rain and calm wind. I called Memphis, and asked for the GPS 20 approach with GARTZ as an IAF. They responded with a climb to 3000, direct GARTZ, and cleared for the approach. About 2 min from GARTZ, Memphis called to tell me about moderate to severe rain ahead and I placed it at 2 miles past GARTZ. And then it began to rain with mild turbulence. At GARTZ, as I turned outbound the rain and turbulence became moderate to heavy. Continuing to track around to inbound the rain became very heavy and turbulence, with gusts and swirling, increased severely. As I was finishing the turn I hit an area of very heavy rain and severe turbulence with a very strong downdraft which led to a severe bank angle, nose down attitude and significant loss of altitude. I reduced power and leveled the wings, then increased to full power and full up but was continuing to descend. After coming out the bottom of the clouds the turbulence significantly decreased. The lowest altitude I saw was 1200 feet. Memphis had called several times and each time I answered back with no response. Troubleshooting, now that the airplane was stable, revealed my knee had pulled out the mic plug. After pushing it back in, I called Memphis to report our situation and they asked if I wanted to continue the approach. Because I was able to see in front of me now that I was below the clouds and saw no significant rain I answered affirmative. I climbed back to the appropriate altitude which I attained just prior to ZEALS and then followed the approach breaking out of the clouds at about 800 feet lined up with the runway. In summary, during a GPS approach I encountered severe turbulence, rain and downdrafts that were unknown to me. This resulted in an unusual attitude and loss of altitude resulting in busting altitude restrictions before I, thankfully, recovered. Additionally, an unplugged mic cord prevented me from contacting Memphis to answer their calls.In reviewing the radar plots, I would have never purposely flown into these conditions, especially at such a vulnerable time as during an approach. I have already scheduled time with my instrument instructor to discuss where I could/should have made different decisions and for further practice in unusual attitude recovery.","","","","PA32 pilot reports encountering severe rain and turbulence during an RNAV 20 approach to MKL.

Release included no alternate airport. Considering the weather report available at that time, an alternate airport was not required. Enroute TPA, ZJX Center advised of thunderstorms developing in the TPA area. Captain (pilot monitoring) left Comm 1 to the flying pilot and called Dispatch to obtain an amendment to the flight release indicating MCO as the alternate airport for the flight. Upon arrival in KTPA area, Approach controllers requested keep 'speed up' and expressed confidence that the 'Popup thunderstorm' would quickly dissipate and/or depart the vicinity of TPA. Just prior to switching to Tower frequency, the initial Approach Controller advised that a MD 88 had just landed TPA reporting minimum visibility due to rain but a smooth ride. Thereafter, TPA Final Approach Controller issued instructions to increase speed for in-trail traffic and cleared Aircraft X for ILS 1L approach, 'Maintain 170 KTS until five-mile final.' We Intercepted glide-slope at 2600 feet with autopilot engaged in approach mode. In order to comply with ATC instructions, initial descent on the GS was conducted with the aircraft in 'Clean' configuration at 170 KTS. When we switched to Tower frequency, the Tower Controller alarmed, 'Windshear Alert! 20 knot change in wind speed on the runway and a wind direction change from 320 to 270.' Pilot monitoring verbalized, 'That's on the runway. We'll be down by then (sic). We can continue.' At approximately 1700 feet, pilot flying requested configuration for landing and Landing Checklist slowing the aircraft to approximately 140 KIAS. As Pilot monitoring flipped switches, made PA, and read the landing checklist, aircraft encountered wall of water associated with thunderstorm over TPA. Pilot flying noted and verbalized increase in airspeed in excess of 20 KTS stating, 'That was more than a 20 knot increase in airspeed! We need to break-off this approach!' Pilot monitoring appeared to note airspeed indications, that the autopilot was engaged, and that the current airspeed corresponded to autopilot maintaining GS despite significant updrafts. At about the same time, Tower Controller transmitted, 'The aircraft ahead reported airspeed deviations of 20 KTS on final and just broke off its approach.' Before we could respond, to the Tower an aircraft on approach behind us interrupted to check-on the frequency and advise the Tower Controller that it had just experienced a 20 knot increase in airspeed and intended to break off its approach. Just then, we encountered another 15 knot [plus] increase in airspeed. At that point, we declared our intention to break off the approach requesting immediate turn to avoid further penetration into the thunderstorm. Tower responded with instructions for left turn to heading of 330 and a climb to 3000 feet. Pressing TOGA on the power levers positioned the flight director nose-up. The pilot flying pushed the power levers forward, asked for max power, initiated climb, asked for flaps 7, noted increase in airspeed indication and climb indication on the VSI, turned toward the desired heading (heading bug had been set by the pilot monitoring) and requested gear up prior to 150 KIAS. When pilot flying verbalized that the FD indicated a turn indication opposite the desired direction, the pilot monitoring pressed the FD mode sector on the autopilot control panel stowing the distraction. We found clear air about five miles from the airport. The crew discussed fuel quantity, considered the fuel consumption effect of another approach attempt... followed by another missed and then a flight to the alternate in trail of several other aircraft that were also likely to also be deviating at that time. Upon receiving additional information from the TPA Approach Controller that the once dissipating thunderstorm now appeared to be building in intensity once again and 'Boiling' over TPA, Aircraft X departed immediately for its alternate, MCO. At least two air carriers and a couple other aircraft diverted to MCO. One B737 aircraft opened that it had plenty of fuel and elected to hold for several minutes. A corporate jet aircraft requested to hold over 'Airshow' to keep an eye on the thunderstorm with expressed intent to advise ATC when ready for approach. The request was denied. The explanation given was that too many aircraft were being diverted through that airspace. Consequently, the jet expressed its intention to divert to LAL. Aircraft X diverted to and landed at MCO without further adventure. Following a personal after-action analysis, and a review of Aircraft X subject matter pertaining to the events, the pilot flying has concluded that a unique cascade of errors lead Aircraft X to commence an approach into severe windshear in violation of company policy. The errors included: -Absence of reliable forecast weather data available to the dispatchers and to the flight crew before the flight departed. -Failure of the flight dispatch process to assure timely monitoring of changing airport conditions throughout the conduct of the flight from departure and prior to the arrival of Aircraft X at TPA.-The initial, intermediate and final approach controller's assurances that the thunderstorm appeared to be local in nature, temporary, dissipating, and moving away from TPA, issuing instructions to 'Keep your speed up,' combined with rapidly changing weather conditions, and miscommunication between the TPA Tower Controller and TPA Approach controllers that were handling the flight. A Flight Dispatcher must monitor the progress of each flight under that Dispatcher's control until the flight has landed or until the Dispatcher is relieved by another Flight Dispatcher and must keep the PIC or any other party involved in operational control notified of any significant weather change that could present a challenge to safety of flight. Flight monitoring, at a minimum, must consist of the monitoring of each flight's fuel state, flight time remaining, destination and alternate airport weather trends, enroute winds and weather (including Pilot or other reports reflecting clear air turbulence, thunderstorms and low level windshear), and the status of airport and navigational facilities.The power of a thunderstorm is extreme and the potential for placing your aircraft, crew and passengers into a hazardous situation is very real. Turbulence, windshear, heavy rain, lightning, ice and hail are all associated with thunderstorms. Crews will use all available resources to detect and avoid thunderstorms.Windshear Avoidance1. Carefully assess all available information such as pilot reports of windshear or turbulence, low-level windshear alerts (LLWSA) and weather reports including thunderstorm activity. Avoid areas of known windshear.2. Severe windshear is that which produces un-commanded airspeed changes greater than 15 knots. If severe windshear is indicated, do not takeoff or continue an approach until conditions improve. Report any windshear encounters precisely and promptly. Whenever a pilot reports windshear, controllers are mandated by regulations to advise other pilots.If windshear conditions with airspeed variations of +- 15 knots from the stabilized approach speed are encountered, a go around should be initiated.","","","","SF340 First Officer reports departing for TPA with a clear forecast and no alternate required.

At FL330 our flight plan had us on the West side of these storms, and knew we eventually had to cross the frontal zone at some point in order to get on east side of the storms. With INDY Center we repeatedly asked for a left deviation to get around the North side of the building storms, and were simply ignored after several attempts. (No call back from INDY Center, nothing, other aircraft equally ignored, except for one, who ignored their INDY ATC, and told the controller, 'I am not letting you fly me through a thunderstorm'). Now we were stuck on the West side of the front and had to deviate even further to the West, with a plan to loop around the weather in South Florida, which was also building. Glad I had dispatch add another 1,000lbs fuel. Eventually had to climb to FL390 to stay above the tops/blow off, with still a 1,200 feet margin to max, altitude, and save fuel. With ATL Center, controller advised that a gap existed in the vicinity of LGC, through which several aircraft were making it through. After a good look on the radar, we proceeded through the recommended gap, SAT -54C. As we crossed the frontal zone, I noticed the airspeed rolling back, and trend vector continuing to show slower passed the clean min maneuvering speed, engines at max climb thrust. Simultaneously we began picking up ice, at least 1/4 inch on the window. I told my First Officer to request FL380 or lower immediately, as the airplane would slow to the point of not being able to maintain FL390. First Officer could not get a word in edge wise as another aircraft (previously denied by ATL ATC) was declaring to ATC they were leaving FL430 for FL410 and could not maintain altitude. SAT was now -27C and the aircraft still slowing now into the clean min man maneuver speed 'J hook'.  Exercised Captain's emergency authority. Switched off the auto pilot and began a descent. Passing FL388 First Officer was able to obtain clearance to FL380. Speed immediately began to build back up to normal, and we continued at FL380. Lowest speed I saw was 219 KTS IAS, and we did not get the 'low speed' aural warning, as the situation was corrected by then. Flight continued normally at FL380 until clear of traffic, and then descended to FL370, appropriate for direction of flight. 1. The abstinence of this controller denying several aircraft of their requests to deviate around the weather set up this whole scenario. (Presumably this controller did not want to be bothered with the pending workload of several reroutes, and the longer he delayed, the further South we would be, and eventually cross into someone else's airspace.

Up to 8000lbs I believe.  The new route had us going ZZZ (VOR).DIESL.MSCT4 into IAH. Once airborne, we needed to deviate around a low overhang from the line of thunderstorms to our east, which is why we needed a reroute. Made contact with center, and they immediately turned us north towards IRW.TORNN. DRLLR4 into IAH. We told them that might not be possible. We tried to negotiate our way back down South, but to no avail. The captain and I determined we had enough fuel to reach IRW plus extra to get us to an airport well east of the line of weather to refuel, and continue on to IAH. We leveled off at FL370 for about 20-30 mins or so. Entered IMC conditions and noticed condensation on the inside of the windshield. Frost formed on the unheated portions of the windshield. About a minute later, we noticed that my airspeed began to drop rapidly, all the way down to zero in a matter of seconds. No changes to the aircraft have been made. The TL's were still set for LRC, and our altitude never changed. The Captain got an amber IAS miscompare message on his PFD, and his airspeed indicator matched the standby airspeed indications. We recognized that pitot 2 has been blocked, most likely by ice. We ran the NAV/FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FAILURE (QRH) Quick Reference Handbook procedure and it guided us to select the ADC reversion button on my reversionary panel. By the time I pushed the button the captain noticed an amber ALT miscompare on his PFD as well, and we noticed my altimeter was about 200 ft high. The same QRH procedure applies to this new message. I pressed the ADC reversion and I am now receiving cross side data for the captain's ADC. The QRH also tells us we are unable RVSM. We notified ATC, and we requested to stay at FL370 for as long as possible for fuel. It took them about 10 mins to get back to us on that answer, but in the meantime, we stayed at FL370 and we realized if we can stay at FL370 we can make it all the way into IAH without a fuel stop. We had a good tailwind that zipped us up to IRW. ATC let us stay at FL370 until we made the turn toward the south.  Once we made the turn southbound, ATC was giving us a series of radar vectors for sequencing into IAH, we declared min fuel, and they instructed us to descend to FL280. We were still up by IRW, so we knew descending to FL280 would significantly increase our fuel burn, so we decide to divert to ZZZ1. After lots of coordination between us and the dispatcher had called ahead to ZZZ1 and told them of our diversion, we amended the release and off we went. On our way to ZZZ1 in IMC we encountered some turbulence, and it kicked the autopilot off. Once we exited the turbulence the autopilot worked without issue. On the descent passing through 280-250 I decided to check and see if my pitot tube was still blocked. At this point we were in VMC conditions and still below freezing, but my airspeed and altitude were back to normal, and were matching up with the stand by and pitot 1 perfectly. So I at this point never re-selected the ADC reversion button again.  Once we landed in ZZZ1, we got more fuel and no passengers deplaned during the process. We were on the ground for less than 20 mins, before we departed to IAH without any issues.Once we landed in Houston, we did not write up the Pitot/static 2 blockage, because the issue resolved itself before landing. I do want to emphasize the ADC failure was not the primary reason for diverting. Even if we had stayed up at FL370, the delayed vectors and sequencing by ATC used up too much fuel and we would have diverted anyway without the ADC failing. Also we did not write it up because it wasn't a conventional failure of the ADC because we did not get any red 'X's' over the airspeed and altitude tapes. Looking back on it now, we should have written up the pitot/static 2 blockage so maintenance can track the issue so they can determine if this is a significant problem on the EMB-145 fleet, and or this particular aircraft. Overall I think us as a crew handled the situation very well. The captain and I had a shared mental model the whole flight. Our communication was spot on, and we effectively managed the threats as to not cause an UAS.  The Flight attendant did an outstanding job keeping the passengers calm, and the coordination with our dispatcher was text book! The reason for my extended duty time was that I had about 6 hours of rest then had to teach a class at the training center. Which counts as FDP if I was going to fly later, which I didn't, because I would have had at least 10 hours after my training event. There were many threats associated with this flight. There was the line of severe weather along our route of flight, it was the last leg of a four day trip for the CA and FA, and just the last leg of a day trip for me. The sun was setting.  On the ground ATC reroute and an airborne ATC reroute. IMC conditions at high altitudes. Landing in ZZZ1, the tower was closed, and it had a shorter runway. We were able to use effective threat and error management to manage the threats associated with this flight, under abnormal circumstances so we never got into an UAS. I would definitely have made sure that we wrote up the pitot/static blockage, so that it can be tracked in our maintenance program.  On the ground [at our departure airport] I could have been more proactive and asked ATC if there were any problems with our filed route, so that we could have put more fuel on board, and avoided a diversion. I hope the company can use the data on the pitot/static 2 blockage to see if it is a recurring problem on our aircraft type, or this particular airplane.","","","","EMB-145 crew diverted to alternate airport due to low fuel state caused by multiple vectors, icing and lower assigned altitude.","200, 280, 28000, 37000","37000",TRUE,TRUE

Although this turned out to be a mere annoyance compared to the weather that was seemingly trying to box us in.During this time we were deviating to the west of a line of weather between us and the airport.  The weather at the field during our arrival was being reported as heavy rain, thunderstorms with a broken ceiling at 4,700 feet.  The landing runway at the time was runway 11.  The winds were being reported at 150 degrees at 4 knots.  With that report (ATIS information alpha at the time) and using a hole in the weather that was located off an extended centerline from runway 11; we planned to make our arrival from the west.We are now tracking south still planning for runway 11.  At the last minute center told us to plan for runway 28 and a turn back to the northeast to heading 030.  A left turn to heading 030 would have put us directly into the storm.  I told center the only way we could take that heading is if it was a right turn to circle us away from the now growing rapidly thunderstorm.  I indicated to center that our radar was only showing a hole in the weather for runway 11.  We were then given a frequency change to approach.  Approach then made multiple attempts to get us to take a turn to directly enter the downwind for runway 29.  After telling him we were unable to do so with the weather we received a very long drawn out response that '[another carrier] did it', 'a Cherokee did it', 'everybody else has been going that way'. He then made an attempt to contact [another] flight and get a 'ride report' seemingly to further entice us to accept his clearance.  Approach was now applying a significant amount of pressure to us to fly directly into in very large thunderstorm.  Not only [did] this storm visually appear to be in the dissipating stage, but our radar showed multiple textbook radar shadows.  Analysis of the storm showed an extreme level of precipitation and a very large risk of hail directly in the area that approach wanted us to fly.  I told approach that his delaying our arrival has put us in a minimum fuel situation should we need to divert to our alternate.  I then told approach that we would need to go back to center and divert back to the north to go around the now very large storm between us and the airport.  After that it further seemed like approach was trying again to get a report of this storm from a [other] aircraft who was in the area; seemingly ignoring the nature of our situation.  This back and forth increased my anxiety level significantly as my experience is telling me that we need to either get on the ground NOW or divert.Finally approach gave up on trying to debate with us and allowed us to return to center and head back north around the storm.  We then went back to Center and approach had misinformed him that we wanted to go hold somewhere.  There was also another comment about other aircraft not doing what we wanted to do.  At this point I reiterated to center that we are in a minimum fuel state and there will be no flying through thunderstorms today for us; and we are not to be further delayed.  He became very chatty on the radio to us at this point which for us is wasting precious time and fuel.  The only way I was able to draw a clearance out of him was to ask him for his supervisor's number.We finally now got the clearance to fly away from the storm to the north which we did and then to the east and then south to enter a right base for runway 29.  During this time we were able to see the storm better visually and while maneuvering for the base and final make another analysis of the storm with the aircraft's radar.  The storm was producing large amounts of precipitation, with severe lightning.While making our turn back to the north I sent two ACARS messages to dispatch to inform him of our situation.  I received a response of'the airport is clear'.  This response made me feel that dispatch did not understand the severity or that just because it's clear at the field doesn't mean we might [not] be dealing with weather between us and the field.  Due to his response I did not feel any further communication to dispatch would have generated any worthwhile information and assistance.  In short his one line response made me lose complete confidence in his ability to provide worthwhile timely information. While on final to runway 29 we observed a wall of rain being produced by the storm with frequently in cloud and cloud to ground lightning.  Had we flown through that storm I am confident that we would had either been struck by lightning, severe risk of hail damage to the aircraft, and the turbulence risk was out of the question. During our deviating we consistently evaluated our fuel situation and made the decision that only one attempt would be made to land at.  Although we landed with slightly less fuel than what we would have needed to fly to [our alternate] and land with the full 45 minutes of fuel; the risk of the divert with weather building rapidly around us, lost confidence of the dispatcher to support us.The risk taking by [another] flight, the Cherokee and [other] aircraft mentioned to us by the approach controller does not automatically mean that I am going to accept those same risks when from my vantage point there is a MUCH less risk option available.  The pressure applied to us by the two controllers was unacceptable.  It is now been almost a full day since the incident and I have Monday morning quarterbacked myself to death over this.  One thing comes to mind and that is as we all know weather is ever changing.  In these situations usually more than not, rapidly.  I will not ever know what the [other carrier] flight and the other general aviation folks saw on their weather resources as I was not in the flight deck with them.However...I was able to pull up the radar history [from a website] when I got to the hotel.  I sure you can imagine it was the absolute first thing I did.  I was questioning myself to see what ATC and Dispatch would/should have been able to see, and now wonder why on earth would they think we would fly through a storm that big? The storm is very clearly identified and if you picture our route you can see our reason for not wanting to fly through/under the storm.  The 'hole' that we had planned to go through closed, ATC no longer accepting the 11 arrivals and dealing with two controls that seemed to be inconvenienced by our weather deviations were the threats of the day.Back to Monday morning quarterbacking myself...Although not mentioned above we landed with 200lbs less than the fuel needed to divert, and then fly for 45 minutes.  Not the worst BUT; this could have been better.  I should have used my emergency authority 200lbs sooner.I should have been more direct with the approach controller and not let him talk up a storm (pun intended).  The miscommunication from the approach controller when we went back to the center controller that we 'wanted to go hold somewhere', further wasted time and precious fuel.   The dispatcher seemingly ignoring the fact that we are in a minimum fuel state and still diverting around severe weather by responding that everything is fine at ZZZ made me prioritize were I spent my time.  Because of his response I did not feel anytime spent re-conveying the message would have not helped our situation and my time was better focused continuing to deviate away from and around the weather.","","","","EMB-145LR Captain reported being pressured by ATC to accept a clearance through severe weather at his destination.","4700","4700",FALSE,FALSE

My hands were on the controls and aircraft was steady at 210 knots assigned and 4000 feet. The auto-pilot was on. We were already briefed and ready for the ILS 01C. All check lists were completed and we were waiting for a vector to final to intercept the ILS. This entire event was over maybe an 8-10 second period. We encountered wingtip vortices from a B737 that was 6 miles in front of us. I had my hands on the controls at the time it started. When all of a sudden the right wing was automatically forced down. I turned the yoke to the left and seemed to regain control of the aircraft. When we were back to level, the wing took another dip. At this point, I thought the autopilot was malfunctioning and quickly hit the trim switch to disengage it quickly. Then when the wing dipped again and with more force and a little further down. This time I had almost full left aileron in to keep the aircraft up right. We were never over 45 degrees at any point. I estimate it to be in the 30-35 degrees. But when it is uncommanded, it was startling, and I was having trouble maintaining 100% control of the aircraft. Then once I would gain control again, it would start again. So, it was an intermittent event, as it would start and stop. By the 3rd time the aircraft was bumped around. We had figured we were hitting a vortex off another aircraft. First officer (F/O) ask if we were following anybody. ATC replied with a B737, 6 miles in front of us. I told him to request an immediate climb, as vortices go down and out. F/O was on the ball and requested it, the controller responded with a climb to 6000 feet. I started an immediate climb and we seemed to be clear of it, after we had climbed maybe 75 feet. Then the controller revised the clearance to maintain 5000 feet. We leveled at 5000 feet and he then turned us east bound on a left base leg. The F/O had 2 or 3 direct transmissions with ATC with no delays or other aircraft talking. He reported the turbulence, asked about traffic, requested a climb, all in a few seconds and it seemed to work out very well. This was maybe a 10 second time period. But, it was very quick, very abrupt, then we were out of it and turning left to intercept and starting a descent back down to 3000 for the approach. I ask him to check on the passengers. They said they were ok, and we would explain once on the ground. Once on the ground, engines shut down. I jumped up to greet them and explain with a big apology for the turbulence. The passenger explained his wife was in the lav and that was a great thing as she was fearful of flying. I explained to them the vortices of airplanes. They were thankful for of our work in the process. At one point, he thought we might actually end up rolling it completely over. I assured him we were not even at the 45 degree mark, but I understand his position being in the back and having a view that would maybe make him think that. They seemed happy and satisfied with the flight and went on their [way].

HPN was departing runway 16 on the SID climbing to 3,000 feet MSL. [Aircraft X] departed HPN in the climb and did not turn per the SID but instead remained runway heading. I did notice the blown SID off of HPN and began to issue [Aircraft Y] a traffic call to point out [Aircraft X] climbing to 3,000 feet. Mid-transmission, I stopped my traffic call since I realized [Aircraft X] was now at 3,500 feet on the next radar sweep. As I began to issue the traffic alert to [Aircraft Y], he keyed up right before I did and responded to the RA he received on Aircraft X still in the climb (now at 3,800 feet) and began his evasive maneuver to turn/climb away from the aircraft in conflict. Targets were approximately 1.2 NM and 300 feet separated at the closest instance. No recommendations can be given since the pilot that departed HPN deviated from the HPN runway 16 SID's turn/altitude published. The climb through 3,000 feet from the J328 was a fast climb rate. Thus, the RA that [Aircraft Y] responded to was obviously the right move steering the aircraft away from [Aircraft Y].","","We were just about to load passengers when my first officer called me to tell me we had a DC tie failure. This led to an flight director to shutdown, an hx fan failure which caused the left pack to overheat and fail. After running the checklist it was determined that we would wait until we got into the air to reset the left pack to let it cool down and try to reset the pack in flight.On the taxi checks the pilot flying and the non flying pilot reset the flight director for takeoff configuration. We selected the left pack and left bleed while on taxi and it still showed as failed so we deselected the bleed and pack for the left side and decided to wait until airborn to try to reset again.With left pack failed the n1% were split by 10-15% being high on left side so pilot flying tried to keep n1 balanced during takeoff roll. At 400 feet the flaps up yaw damp on call was made as normal. On Climb out I continued to monitor the n1 guages to maintain balance. The flight director was selected for nav mode and I continued to follow the command bar directions which did not command the right turn from the SID.  At acceleration height I called for climb check and at the same time ATC called to see if we started our turn. We advised we were starting turn and turned at less than standard bank for passenger comfort. While in the turn and climbing at 3,500 feet per minute ATC then advised a turn to heading 350 in which I selected the autopilot on in heading mode. Close to roll out on the 350 degree heading the non flying pilot noticed traffic on the right both high and low. Traffic low was a blimp off the departure end of the runway and to the west, traffic high was jet traffic on a converging course. We also noted at this time that the autopilot had not captured the 3,000 feet as selected in the altitude select. I then clicked off the auto pilot and agressivly nosed the airplane down for a descent to maintain seperation from the higher jet traffic. Once leveled off at 3,000 feet we continued to recieve radar vectors for another 10 min until being told to go direct to JFK VOR. Enroute to JFK we reselected the autopilot on and continued to closely monitor all climbs and level offs until cruise altitude. At this point I called for the QRH cheklist for pack failure. The non flying pilot was to run the checklist while I Flew the plane and ran the radios. We got the left pack back online and continued for a few more minutes. Shortly after crossing the JFK VOR the flight director went off line in flight. I elected at this to hand fly the aircraft until we reached Atlantic City airport as I suspected there was an issue with the flight guidance system. Upon dropping off our passangers I then called maintenance about the pack failures and DC tie failure. We discussed possible reasons for DC tie failures. We conducted a quick evaluation consisting of turning off a DC hydraulic pump and turning it back on. We discovered there was a spike in the system which was determined why the pack and flight director had failed. Maintenance suggested if it happened again, were we lost the flight director on the ground,to shut the airplane down to reset the systems of the autopilot. I also called our company saftey manager to discuss the chain events that led to the RA. I also called the director of operations and discussed these items with him as well. Upon contiuing our day the autopilot system seemed to work normally but we had one more occurance of DC tie failure before the end of our duty day. The cause the the problems were multiple system malfunctions before takeoff that led to erroneous readings in a high traffic voulme environment causing crew to have to take evasive actions to avoid conflict. We fly SIDs and STARS on a daily basis and rely on the auto guidance system to give us correct information. To prevent this from happening in the future the non flying pilot and I have discussed how we could change the after takeoff scanof the instrumentaion and the priority of what should be handled first in a situation like this.","","N90 TRACON Controller and both pilots report of a RA and a loss of separation  due to the aircraft climbing above its assigned altitude.

We were descending via the arrival. Due to some enroute deviation for weather, we were anticipating landing with 3700lb at ZZZ. As weather started moving into the ZZZ area, ATC began issuing us vectors off route and started giving holding instructions to other aircraft on the arrival. ATC began rerouting aircraft to a north arrival for which I determined that we didn't have enough fuel to accept. As the off route vectors continued I queried ATC about holding for us. I was developing a diversion plan for ZZZ1 and working on our BINGO fuel and trying to get the weather for ZZZ1. During this time the FO was flying the aircraft, navigating through cells. I told Dispatch via ACARS that we needed a diversion alternate. We got no reply from Dispatch. I declared MIN FUEL when we were projecting 3000 LBS FOB at ZZZ. At which time Approach told us it would be approximately an hour before they could accept us. At that time I made the decision to turn to ZZZ1. As we made the turn we realized we would be landing with ~2000 LBS FOB at ZZZ1. I felt that in the interest of safety I needed a closer airport and with ATCs assistance decided on ZZZ2 due to runway length, weather, and proximity. Throughout the entire time once we began receiving delay vectors, we were not able to reach Dispatch through ACARS or radio. I decided that if I was going to land at ZZZ1 with 2000 LBS FOB, then I would be declaring an emergency and if I declared an emergency, I would never overfly a suitable airport. I understand that ZZZ2 is not in our Ops Specs, but I deemed it the safest option at the time. I could not see where the weather was in relation to ZZZ1 and was unwilling to risk flying there only to meet significant weather. We were handed off to Center who gave us the Unicom frequency at ZZZ2. The Tower was closed at the time and we made multiple calls to Unicom during the visual approach. The FO landed the aircraft at ZZZ2 without incident. On the ground there was some difficulty getting in contact with the airport authorities and getting the aircraft fueled, but the majority of the time was spent waiting on the weather to pass through the area so that fueling could resume. Additionally, there were complications with the fueling due to the Fueler not having experience with our aircraft. Dispatch paperwork and ZZZ2 charts were sent via email to my company iPad and shared with FO. On the ground at ZZZ2, I was in constant communication with Dispatch via cell phone and we were developing a plan to avoid breaking DOT TDP limitations. A cell passed through the area at around 1 hour after landing which prevented us from attempting fueling for 40-50 minutes. We opened the Tarmac Delay Kit around 2 hours after landing. ZZZ2 Tower was working to find airstairs in the event we needed to deplane. At 2.5 hours after landing, we determined that we needed to have means to deplane the passengers if any wanted to leave. Tower had arranged for airstairs but we still had no transportation / shelter arrangements for passengers should they deplane. The fueling was accomplished properly with coordination with Maintenance Control and the local fuel service. Initially there was a fuel imbalance of approximately 3000 LBS upon completion of fueling, but through Maintenance Control we accomplished a fuel transfer procedure that rectified the imbalance. The fueling was completed around 2.5 hours and the imbalance was rectified. I made the announcement around after landing that if passengers wanted to deplane we would accommodated that, but we were also 20 minutes from taking off - as we had the fuel on board and we were ready to proceed. No passengers elected to deplane at that time. We started engines, took off and proceeded to ZZZ without any further difficulties. The rest of the crew did an outstanding job. The FO flew well and was able to manage multiple tasks while I was off frequency and trying to develop our diversion plan. His judgment and communication was absolutely essential to the safe outcome of the flight. The passengers were pleasant, supportive and understanding throughout the whole ordeal and I attribute that directly to the two outstanding flight attendants we had. They took great care of the passengers and remained calm, patient, and professional. For all my flights into ZZZ, I will be increasing my personal minimums for fuel requirements when weather is in the area and will require having enough fuel to fly to ZZ1 or ZZZ3 - regardless if an alternate is legally required. I will also be more proactive in contacting Dispatch for weather updates when weather is moving into the area. If I don't receive contact from Dispatch in a timely manner, I will begin planning for diversion sooner. I will try and maintain situational awareness of the on-line airports in the area, and believe that it's almost impossible to determine what airports are 'On-line' airports when you are in short range diversion planning. As soon as they mentioned holding, I started planning on ZZZ1, knowing it was On Line and as soon as I realized we would land there with 2000 LBS FOB, I knew we had to make another plan.","","I was the First Officer. The Captain did his briefing at the gate in [departure airport]. I noticed at the time and said the fuel is on the low side of approximately 17.9 and I did notice that we were not assigned an alternate. The flight progressed normally apart from a slight delay from the inbound plane, and conversations between the Captain and a passenger who had checked his bag with his laptop in it. But after these events the flight continued normally. We had a message from dispatch that there were thunderstorms/buildups ahead at least 2 hours into the flight. We used the weather radar for the remainder of the flight and deviated around big buildups. I looked at the ATIS for ZZZ and the arrival conditions looked favorable and they were indicating southerly landings. I loaded [runway] into the MCDU. On arrival we went through serious buildups with light to moderate chop. ATC told us to make a right 360 for spacing. After completing this maneuver, ATC informed us that ZZZ had shut and ask us to indicate our intentions. I personally glanced down and noticed the fuel display to be about 3000 pounds total. I typed to dispatch that ZZZ was not taking arrivals for at least an hour. The Captain was looking at options to land. There were communications of Airplanes diverting and going different routes to ZZZ. However, after putting these routes into the MCDU the fuel remaining at destination was very low. We received an ACARS message to go to ZZZ1 but Dispatch indicated we would need 1700 pounds to get to ZZZ1 via ZZZ VOR. To get to ZZZ VOR would obviously take fuel and we could not have gone a straight line distance due to the Thunderstorms. The fuel remaining for ZZZ VOR to ZZZ1 would have been very low. The Captain at this point asked ATC for options around where we were. They gave a couple which included ZZZ2. Information about this airfield was read to us. The Captain entered the information and set up for an approach. I sent an ACARS to Dispatch that our intentions were to go to ZZZ2. At some point a message from Dispatch appeared saying ZZZ2 was not in our ops specs. The messages to and from Dispatch were very slow. This caused me personal frustration because usually the service is outstanding. An approach was made with ATC and then advisory frequency to ZZZ2. The weather at the field at that time was VFR. I noticed the runway length. I made a positive placement and put on the brakes firmly. The Captain taxied the aircraft off the runway. The Captain spoke with the Tower and gave us progressive taxi instructions to the FBO to bring the aircraft to a stop and contact Company personnel. We both noticed quickly that the entrance/Taxiway to the FBO was narrow so the Captain taxied the airplane 180 and brought the aircraft to a stop on the taxiway. Both engines were shut down and the parking checklist was completed. That is when I noticed the fuel on both sides was yellow - approximately 2000 pounds on board. The Captain became very busy speaking with company. I was talking with Tower and told them that the Captain was speaking with Company. The Company told us we would need approximately 9100 pounds of fuel. A fueler truck turned up along with security and a fire truck. Later other vehicles arrived. Then the weather got very bad with thunder and lightning directly over the field. The process stopped anything happening for approximately 2 hours. Meanwhile the Captain was liaising with Company which included Dispatch, Director of Operations, Scheduling, Maintenance, and others. Charts, numbers and a new flight release for a flight to ZZZ were sent via email.Once the lightning moved through the area, fueling began again. However, fuel was pumped more into one side than the other so the Captain spoke with Maintenance and this problem was rectified. The door was never opened. We ran the tarmac delay process - Drinks were offered and bars were opened. This was confirmed with Dispatch. I got the clearance, programmedthe MCDU and got the aircraft ready for flight. The Aircraft was set up and Passengers were seated. We prepared for departure. A decision was taken to use no flex. Subsequently a normal departure from ZZZ2 and flight occurred without incident to ZZZ. A thorough discussion of weather TAFs and METARs at destination.Thorough communications between Dispatch and Aircraft.As much notice as possible of intended closures of airports.Maybe on this occasion a diversion to ZZZ4 for example would have been advantageous.","","The flight approached a low fuel situation when weather moved into the vicinity of the destination airport. They declared minimum fuel, but the airport closed. They diverted to a nearby non-operation specifications airport, refueled, and proceeded to the original destination. An alternate airport was not required prior to departure.","","",FALSE,FALSE

We initially lost about 400 feet of altitude then an immediate reversal of the descent to about 2000 FT per minute climb to about 3,500 FT MSL before regaining control over the altitude. We also received roll deviations which were corrected. Upon the initial encounter of the turbulence, I called for a go-around and proceeded to advise ATC of the severe turbulence and advised we were not able to maintain our assigned altitude of 3,000 ft. The First Officer maintained wings and pitch level as best he could and added power as I brought the condition levers up. We received a vector to exit the approach corridor and proceeded south where we continued to receive moderate turbulence. We reconfigured the aircraft for normal flight and advised ATC we would need to divert.  Heavy rain showers in the area created moderate turbulence all around PHL. ATC advised the approach corridor looked acceptable on the radar so we accepted the approach clearance. We also did not detect any signs that severe turbulence may occur on the aircraft radar. We proceeded with a go-around and exited the area of severe turbulence and diverted. A maintenance write up was made because of the severe turbulence encounter. I believe there is a stigma about calling turbulence severe. If the aircraft in front of us had advised ATC that the turbulence was in fact severe, we would have never proceeded with the approach.

Upon arrival in the terminal area, the weather extended from 20 NM south of the airport extending over the airport and the approach path to 20 NM north of the airport.  This was confirmed with approach control. We first deviated around the weather to the north; received vectors for the ILS to [a west] runway; broke off the approach; then flew back around the weather again to the north and shot an approach and landing to [the south]. In addition to the strong radar returns, the wind was gusting and approach control had earlier called a wind shear warning of a 15 knot loss. I also saw flashes of lightning directly over or very close to the airport (it was on my side). It was my leg and I did not feel it wise or at least the best course of action to complete either approach in such severe conditions.I suggested we go hold until the line of weather passed, perhaps 15-20 minutes maximum.  We had the fuel and our alternate was clear.  [The Captain] completely ignored my suggestions and inputs in the end. It soon became apparent to me [the Captain] was determined to land despite my now fervent suggestions to do otherwise; so prior to glide slope intercept on [the south runway], I initiated a safe transfer of aircraft control to [the Captain] and assumed support duties. He completed the approach and landing with some difficulty.  On short final he had us at full scale defection high on the Glide Path: both electronic and the PAPI (4 white). I called 'glide slope deviation' yet he elected to continue the landing. To further exacerbate the situation, [the Check Airman] sat in the jumpseat and said nothing, not a single word. Giving no input of any kind which may have supported a wiser course of action.  While we were in a phase of flight which requires a sterile cockpit, that did not or should not have prevented him from joining in a fight related, potentially safety related conversation.I felt it to be a blatant disregard for CRM in ignoring my suggestions when a simple and safer course of action which I was proposing existed. I have 9000+ hours in the 767, most of it flying to Florida with its many thunderstorms, I have been a Captain here at [this airline] and several years ago, I received several months worth of radar interpretation training in USAF Navigator Training. I have NEVER seen anyone even attempt to land with such intense radar returns. If Captains and Check Airmen do not heed the concerns and suggestions of experienced first officers, what is the purpose CRM training?In conflict with the FOM, I took a photo of the severe radar returns covering the approach, because I feared the Captain's insistence to continue the approach and landing had the potential at the very least to damage the aircraft and I felt I need something to support my position that it was unsafe to continue.  The autopilot was engaged and I certainly deem it safer to take a few seconds to take the photo in case a far greater incident occurred.  It is not something I would consider unsafe or even unwise at that juncture when I was being 'squashed' and the airplane and I were being directed in the wrong way by the Captain.","","","","B767 First Officer reported the Captain ignored his concerns about landing at the destination with severe weather in the area.","","",FALSE,FALSE

With heavy arrival traffic, the controllers were unable to route arrivals to completely avoid the weather.  Coming in on final, we had to fly through very heavy rain and turbulence approaching INESS. Out of concern for windshear, the FO attempted to maintain extra speed and as clean a configuration as possible, with which judgement I concurred. ATC was assigning the airspeeds, as traffic was spaced closely.  We planned flaps 30, because it had appeared from the radar that the runway would be wet. We approached 1500 MSL and INESS with 150 KIAS assigned, flaps 20, and gear up.  At this point we came out of the rain, and had good visual conditions for landing, and were lined up on final and on the glideslope according the PAPIs.  The FO called for gear down and flaps 25, but I had to wait for flaps 25 until the gear showed down.  With the gear down, selected flaps 25, but we experienced a windshear which raised the IAS above the 162 maximum for flaps 30.  The FO took maneuvering action to reduce, so we could select 30, but by this time we were below 1000 AGL.  With the new requirement to not complete any of the last 3 items of the landing checklist before final flaps, the checklist also had to be completed below 1000 feet.  I made the command decision, that with the hazardous weather conditions (a major thunderstorm minutes from the airport, with others in the area), a go-around would be more dangerous than continuing the approach, as we were on centerline, on glidepath, and correcting to approach speed, in visual conditions with a 13,000 foot runway in sight, so we proceeded to a normal landing and rollout.This would have been much easier, had the ILS to runway 9 been active, instead of trying to comply with the LOC only approach.  The LOC only approach puts the aircraft above optimum glidepath at INESS, making speed reduction more difficult on the steeper path required after INESS.  As it was, when we got into visual conditions, we were able to use the PAPIs for glidepath guidance, which worked out ok.  Had we not achieved visual conditions before 1000 AGL, a go-around back into the hazardous weather would have been unavoidable.  I would suggest that MIA airport do what is necessary to get the full ILS back in operation.","","","","B757 Captain reports having to penetrate heavy rain and turbulence while conducting a localizer only approach.

Crossing SEAVU it suddenly became apparent that the active waypoint was not appropriate for the ILS 25L approach appearing to be the ILS 24L instead. Crew worked together to reinsert the correct approach and made correction back to appropriate course. At that point the data tag indicated the aircraft was 1.1 nm right of course.

After briefing with my FO, I decided to build the arrival and RWY 24R approach in the secondary just in case they gave that to us. My F/O pointed out that the other runway offered was the ILS 24L and that is because RWY 24R was reported as closed. I noticed that also when I told him what I was doing. I then went back in and rebuilt the ILS RWY 24L. That is where I must have made a mistake and actually loaded RWY 24L in the active flight plan in the FMS. We had already briefed the whole arrival going into LAX with 25L and so we did not notice the change since the arrival is the same until the plane gets to SEAVU waypoint. After SEAVU waypoint the heading is the same for all runways and the only thing different is the waypoint that begins the approach for each runway. As we were descending on the arrival I was verbalizing each waypoint and what was next as far an altitude and airspeed restrictions. When we got to SEAVU I noticed immediately that the next waypoint was not the waypoint that begins the RWY 25L approach. Since I was pilot flying I directed the FO to quickly enter the correct runway. By the time we got the ILS RWY 25L into the FMS we were very close to the point LUVYN which is the point that begins the approach for RWY 25L. This caused a slight overshoot and we turned to get back on course. There were never any altitude discrepancies and we then flew the approach and landing without incident. As I indicated earlier, I built the FMS and briefed the arrival and approach and then decided to go back and enter a different arrival and runway in the Secondary flight plan in the FMS. Normally I would do that during my initial build and brief and then the error would have been caught. Nevertheless, I made a mistake and built the arrival and approach for RWY 24R. We saw that ATIS showed the other approach was RWY 24L and not RWY 24R so I went back to the FMS and reentered the arrival and approach for RWY24L in the Secondary. This is where I must have mistakenly entered the arrival and approach for RWY24L in the Active flight plan. Since we had already briefed the whole arrival and approach for RWY25L we did not debrief the Active. As we progressed in the arrival I maintain a good watch on all altitudes and airspeed requirements and did not notice the wrong runway was in the Active until we got to SEAVU and I saw that the next waypoint was not the one I was expecting. We then fixed the problem.Lesson learned for me is to build and brief after all FMS inputs are complete.

We complied with this, and as we approached GEELA we were given a speed reduction, which we complied with.  At .3 DME prior to CHAVO with the aircraft in LNAV/VNAV PATH, the aircraft was leveling at 9000 feet at 210 knots as depicted on the arrival.  It was mid-afternoon in PHX with temperature in the low 100s and occasional moderate turbulence.  At this point I received a VNAV disconnect message, which I cleared.  In the few seconds it took to assess what the aircraft was doing, and reengage a mode on the MCP, the aircraft may have crossed CHAVO up to 200 feet low since I had the bottom altitude of 7000 feet in the Altitude window while the airplane was VNAV PATH.  I had applied a little power while determining whether I needed to level or continue descent.  Now, (maybe five seconds after the disconnect) we were past CHAVO. I decided to idle the power, dial 1000 FPM into Vertical Speed and continue the descent to comply with LEMOE at 7000 feet.  With the turbulence and the disconnect, the speed had accelerated to near 230 knots.  I deployed speed boards to slow the aircraft back to 210 knots while continuing to comply with the LEMOE crossing restriction.","","We were descending on the HYDRR 1 RNAV Arrival, Runway 25L transition, into PHX. We just received the new ATIS, which included a windshear advisory. The arrival was normal until AGGLA, with LNAV and VNAV PATH engaged. As we were approaching CHAVO, 210 knots/9000 FT, the FO had to deploy the speedbrakes as the airspeed was increasing. Simultaneously, we encountered moderate chop. The Controller asked us what the winds were, and I reported they were 350/10. At that moment, I think the VNAV PATH disconnected. It appeared the aircraft was not going to level at 9000 FT because the Vertical Speed was also increasing! The FO immediately tried to level the aircraft and arrest the increasing speed, but I believe we went below 9000 FT at CHAVO. Our maximum airspeed through the event was 220 knots. We were back in VNAV PATH after CHAVO, and the rest of the arrival and landing were uneventful. The FO thought we made the CHAVO restriction, but I'm not so sure. There were no other aircraft involved, and the Controller did not say anything else to us.Although I don't think this was a full-blown windshear event, I suspect a combination of the shifting tailwind and turbulence drove the VNAV to disconnect. Also, the thrust levers were at idle, and the speedbrakes were deployed throughout. Therefore, I don't think the FO could have done much more to slow down. Finally, I think the FO did a good job of recognizing this dynamic event, and responding about as quickly as he could.Although I don't think the FPA went to VNAV SPD, an additional signal to alert us when the FPA comes out of PATH, or switches to SPD, would be very helpful. I'm sure many other Pilots would agree.","","B737 flight crew experience a VNAV disconnect during the HYDRR1 RNAV Arrival into PHX approaching CHAVO.

Clouds were thin cirrus. There were T-storms about 20-25 miles to the right, east of us. They were all that showed on the aircraft radar. The flight had been uneventful in all ways. No turbulence was reported or experienced until the event. Then the aircraft experienced instantaneous severe turbulence for about 5 seconds. It felt like hitting pot holes in a fast car with no shocks. Worst episode I have encountered in 34 years of flying. The autopilot roll mode disengaged due to the severity of the event. Aircraft control was impossible for those 5 seconds. I lowered my head to avoid possible impact with ceiling and watched the instruments. Aircraft descended and banked left 20-25 degrees. Speed remained constant around 300 KTS. No stall warning, no overspeed clacker but when the turbulence stopped and I tried to level the plane I realized the autopilot was in CWS (Control Wheel Steering). I disengaged the autopilot, regained control of the aircraft and re-engaged it. Then we called the cabin crew to assess any injuries. Next we informed ATC of the event. We asked for medical services to meet us at the gate. We got direct clearance to short final and I kept the speed up. I flew 270 KTS for a bit below 10,000 ft. We sent ACARS messages to dispatch in reference to the event. No further turbulence was encountered and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.

The weather was indeed very turbulent, the seatbelt sign was turned off and on several times during the flight with the services interrupted and passengers having to wait on LAV use. During this time we all had excellent communication between all crewmembers. A special notice given to CA for putting safety at top priority.  After several attempts of service and having to stop and sit down because of chop, the seatbelt sign was turned off and I instructed the other Flight Attendants (FA) to wait on service due to the amount of passengers needing the LAV.  After the crowd died down we then began our service. The D and C were at the rear of cabin and almost done with service, the B had just entered AFT galley and was prepping cart for trash pick up and I was in the FWD galley finishing the last part of the First Class meal service. A Passenger had come forward as the other passenger had finished with FWD LAV use and stopped to chat with me. She was standing at galley entrance and was between me and the FWD jumpseat. As we were talking, we experience unreported and unexpected moderate to severe turbulence. In those few seconds of sheer shaking and pandemonium. I instinctively went for the jumpseat but, passenger was in the way and holding on to galley wall. I immediately instructed her loudly to take the seat as I reached around and lowered the seat. She sat down as things where flying off the countertops of galley and I sat next to her. As we were trying to keep from being thrown off the jumpseat I helped her with the harness as I was putting my on. She was very scared and was concerned for her baby. She had a fellow seat passenger hold the baby back at seat. I commanded her that she would stay seated and that in no way was she getting up to get to her baby.  SEATBELT SIGN WAS TURNED ON. I proceeded to look down the aisle and other then seeing a passenger crawling to his seat and one passenger in AFT LAV, none of the passengers had been up and no one was hurt. I could see the other FAs had made it to the AFT jumpseats and carts were in the galley.  As soon as it was safely possible and it seem that the chop had died, I called the CA and he immediately asked if anyone was hurt and I said it did not appear so. He informed me that was totally unexpected. I informed him that cabin crew were seated and that I had a passenger next to me in jumpseat for safety reasons. He concurred that due to unexpected moderate to severe chop that was the safest place for her. He instructed us to stay seated and I made announcements to passengers passing on this instruction and so did the CA. As soon as it was safe and seatbelt sign was turned off, Passenger returned to her seat. We walked through cabin and check on passengers and no one was hurt. Cabin Crew informed me that it was very severe in back and the carts had actually come of the floors.  B immediately took her seat in galley. Before the D and C could get to back to the galley they both squatted and held on. The cart in aft part of aisle came up off the floor and several items spilled and on passengers but nothing hot. They then got the cart to the galley and took seats. Except for the weather and intermittent chop for the rest of flight nothing of it was as severe as what we had just experienced. We did prepare cabin on descent to [destination airport] but all was ok. Please contact me for information.Moderate to severe chop and passenger standing between me and jumpseat.Actually I would like to hear feedback from ASAP regarding passenger in jumpseat. In the interest of SAFETY and the fact that I instinctively reacted to this turbulence I believe it was the very right decision to put her in the jumpseat. She could not be placed in LAV as it had no seatbelt, ALL First Class seats were occupied and even if one was open she safely could not reach them or her seat in Main Cabin. I did not want her on the floor and watch her bounce around while I safely sat in my seat. Think of the media attention and public attention that FA had empty and safe jumpseat next to him while he was safely in his seat watching [the] mother of [a] baby being thrown around. Not to mention the lawsuit as well.  After speaking with entire crew, my instinctive reaction for safety of passenger and myself was the correct reaction. But because she was not qualified to seat in jumpseat, I submitted ASAP.","","","","A flight attendant reported encountering unexpected moderate to severe turbulence with seatbelt sign off.

Immediately after wheels off the ground the windshear alert sounded. We got 3 orals and windshear guidance. The First Officer was pilot flying (PF) [and] I was pilot monitoring (PM). We were going up to 10,000 feet which had been set. During our windshear recovery ATC gave us a new heading and I read back something like the heading and also that we were in windshear recovery and encountering severe turbulence. As we were reaching 10,000 feet, I was telling the FO to watch his pitch and altitude. The FO was doing the best he could with the conditions we were in. As we were passing through 10,000 feet ATC gave us 14,000 feet. We set 14,000 feet. Somewhere in between 10,000 feet and 13,500 feet ATC tried to give us a phone number to call. I told him to standby and we were still in severe windshear and turbulence. About 13,500 feet we exited into better conditions. We were on a reposition flight, the aircraft was light and climbing rapidly. About this time I told the FO to watch his altitude. I said it a few times and tried to assist him to push the nose down. We were unable to level off in time. ATC told us we went through 14,000 feet. We got back down as quick as possible. We got the autopilot on, took down the number from ATC, and made a PIREP.  In the future faced with a similar situation with a thunderstorm approaching the field I'd heavily consider waiting until it passed the field before departing. My thought at the time was several aircraft departed ahead of us took off so I figured we would be OK. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. If I do encounter windshear/significant turbulence in the future on departure I would be much more vigilant at making my call outs of airspeed, pitch corrections, and heading corrections. I would tell ATC to standby windshear recovery and leave it at that until we were completely clear of the conflict. But in hindsight I should have decided to wait it out.","","In hind sight I would also consider rejecting the takeoff if the wind is drastically different than reported judging by the corrections required to maintain the Runway Centerline.","","An air carrier crew took off into a line of thunderstorms, encountered windshear immediately after liftoff and initiated the windshear recovery procedure.

The aircraft was flown by myself and was on a long cross-country flight to Stella Maris Bahamas, conducted during daylight and in VFR conditions. The flight conditions had started to degrade during the flight sometime after a refuel stop, in Northern Florida. As many thunderstorms popped up enroute, I had to make may course changes to avoid IMC and thunderstorms, with onboard weather (XM) I was able to make tactical choices to head East and clear through the East Coast where the thunderstorm activity was significantly less. I had contacted Jacksonville Center for advisories enroute and as I was near Titusville, FL the ATC controller told me to turn South heading, I reaffirmed that I was not able to travel any further South as there was a level 4 thunderstorm within five miles of my position. At this point, there were few options, she stated I could climb or descend but none were on option as I was above class B airspace at 11,500 MSL and was not cleared and could have been in IMC if I had complied with instructions, my fault was that I did not see the restricted airspace to the East, R2934 and R2935 for the NASA launch facility. The weather constraints and issues with ATC, fighting them to keep them from sending me into a thunderstorm pushed me further South and into the restricted airspace.

However, at this point these airports were equal distance from each other and [one] was behind us. With all the consideration and factors we continued [to the destination]. With our estimated fuel on arrival continuing to be reduced, we elected to declare MIN FUEL to the Controller and Dispatcher, planning [visual approach]. At that point we were landing with approximately 1.6 fuel and planning the [visual approach to XY] (as our previous flights were and it was a non-event / no delays). We were given descend via [a second arrival]. Once on approach we informed them also that we were min fuel.At this point we were task saturated. Approach informed us that we will be doing the LDA XY with a +12 mile final, which was different than expected from the Visual XY of less than a 6 mile final. When we inserted the LDA Z XY into the FMS, it showed our estimated fuel on arrival at being 850 lbs. At that point, we immediately decided to [advise ATC we were minimum fuel] due to the inability to complete the entire LDA XY approach. Once [we advised ATC of our fuel state], ATC immediately turned us to the right and said go direct to ZZZZZ Intersection I believe (which was on LDA Y XY). LDA Y XY is not in the FMS and we said we needed Z.There was confusion with ATC with our inability for Y vs. Z, as we were all task saturated at that point. He said unable Z, and asked if we had the [landmark]. We were in and out of IMC/VMC. At that point we crossed the inbound course to LDA XY / north side of the [landmark]. I do not believe we penetrated [restricted airspace] but there is a chance that it did happen, but I do not believe we did. Controller advised 220 degree heading while we were in IMC, which was complied with.CA came on the radio really quickly and asked what is ATC's plan if we don't get the [landmark in sight]. A few seconds later we had visual on the [landmark] and FO (First Officer) called in sight, which was off our right. At that point, we were cleared Visual XY. Once we were taken off the arrival and immediately turned in for the visual, our fuel became min fuel status.We flew the Visual to XY and advised to contact Tower. On contact with Tower, ATC asked if we preferred XZ. We declined XZ, as the CA personally has never landed or taken off from XZ, and we had numbers for XY. It was the best course of action to continue with the original plan of XY so it did not make the situation more complex. Cleared to land XY. Landed on XY, and clearedat Taxiway D I believe. Continued taxi without incident. Upon arrival at the gate, we had approximately 1.5/1.6 FOB (Fuel on Board).The [admission of low fuel to ATC] was necessary and the safest course of action due to the expected approach, etc. However, since we were taken off the arrival and not the long final, it enabled our fuel at gate to remain approximately 1.5/1.6. Upon arrival, CA called TRACON to discuss the confusion with Y/Z as they wanted to know where the confusion happened. CA informed them we were unable to accept direct ZZZZZ Intersection due to FMS limitations and the last minute changes and task saturations. He said something along the lines of understanding that [company] has issues with Y, etc.","","In my humble opinion, I believe the event could have been avoided. It's not uncommon to receive extended vectors or numerous reroutes going in to ZZZ or any other high traffic volume airport. In this case, our flight was twenty-three minutes over planned block time and the majority of that time was spent flying ATC assigned headings. We were given minimum RESERVE fuel, zero ALT or HOLD fuel and only TANKER 697 lbs. If our flight was adequately fueled beyond the absolute minimum levels, I do not believe this event would have occurred. It seems to be extremely common that crews are only given MIN fuel for flights, with no contingency fuel added. Unless contingency fuel starts to be added to all flights, I believe this sort of event will continue to occur.","","CRJ-200 flight crew reported being dispatched with minimum fuel landing at their east coast destination with very low fuel on board after a series of ATC vectors.","29000, 33000","29000",TRUE,TRUE

The inflight weather conditions was IMC with occasionally light to moderate turbulence for approx the last 40 - 50 miles till touch down due to heavy/extreme precipitation in the area and thunderstorms on the intercept course from the arc to the localizer course as well as the departure end of the runway. We asked the Approach Controller for vectors to the localizer to prevent flying into the weather that was showing on the aircraft radar. The FO (First Officer) had the radar up on the MFD (Multifunction Display), while the terrain was in the captain's side MFD. The Controller said that there was no radar contact as well as WX radar capability for the airport terminal area as well as him continuously asking us 'what's your position?'. We started the approach from 15,000 feet past CONDE intersection, I told the FO we need to get down to ten thousand feet (which is depicted on the approach plate) to better set up for the approach without being high and unstable. He replied that the night prior at the same airport, he (FO PF), started down early and had a terrain caution. I explained to him, if you are on the published segment of the approach and complying with the altitude restrictions, there should be no problem with any terrain cautions. We started the arc and as we briefed earlier, that was to cut the corner of the WX to intercept the localizer and shoot the ILS approach, we agreed and went as planned. The configuration at this point was flaps 8, speed 220 with a trend to 200 knots slowing for landing configuration. The FO went into heading mode and flew an intercept angle of approx 30 degrees at the point we talked about. As we were flying closer to the localizer, green needles at this point, I noticed the approach mode was not armed and we started fly through the localizer. When I brought this to his attention, the FO immediately disengaged the auto pilot to save the approach. I told him to start a climb and go missed and turn the auto pilot back on due to the WX. After engaging the auto pilot, I had to assist the FO to initiating a climb to 15,000 (now being unprotected and in terrain environment). I told the Controller that we had to miss and if there is a way (due to position SE of the field), can we do the ILS DME 1 runway 14. The Controller approved the request and I briefed to the FO to switch to VOR frequency and track the 348 radial outbound to 8 DME to intercept the localizer for the runway. During the maneuvering I briefed the approach and mentioned to the FO he needed to position himself better so as to be out of the cone of confusing for a proper setup of the course. The FO started to turn towards the VOR and asked if I wanted to fly it. I asked him, 'Do you feel like you can handle this?', he said yes. Noticing that we were not going to successfully shoot the ILS DME 1 runway 14, I asked the Controller can we proceed to CONDE intersection and rejoin the arc for the ILS DME 2 runway 14. This is after a quick calculation of fuel to know that we had time to try one more attempt till proceeding to the alternate, QRO. The Controller approved the request and we vectored ourselves back to CONDE intersection. While setting up for the approach, the stick shaker came 'on' for a second. The airspeed indicated approximately 175 Knots. While observing the airspeed the stick shaker again came 'on'. I immediately positioned both trust levers to MAX CON and questioned the FO as to what he was doing. The FO replied that he was watching me. I instructed the FO to return the aircraft to 200 Knots and maintain normal flight conditions. Upon returning to normal flight conditions I completed the approach setup and again briefed the FO on the approach. We then successfully intercepted the course inbound on the arc. I transferred the FCC (Flight Control Computer) to the CA side and told the FO to go green, and, tune and identify the localizer on his side while the autopilot flew the arc in white needles on the Captain's FCC. When on the altitudes published and established on the arc, the FO went to HDG mode to intercept the localizer as agreed to during the briefing. The FCP (Flight Computer Plan) on the CA side must have still been in the NAV mode because when I was going green just before the intercept point, which we agreed upon, the FMA went to ROLL mode before transferring back to the FOs FCC card so as to go to APP mode. The FO never caught the ROLL mode on the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciation). I asked him just before the localizer started coming alive, 'why are you in ROLL mode?'. He replied, 'I don't know.' I then told him to arm the approach, the aircraft once again started to fly past the localizer while the approach mode was trying to correct for the localizer and current winds. That's when the FO disengaged the auto pilot and put the aircraft in a bank to try and re-intercept the localizer, which triggered the EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System) 'BANK ANGLE'. I immediately took the controls while I monitored the bank passing 45 degrees to reaching approx 70 degrees and said 'my aircraft'. We were able to re-intercept the ILS due to close proximity of the course with the autopilot re-engaged and fully configured just before G/S intercept. When we broke out, there were four whites to three whites one red and landed the aircraft without further issues. Recommendations would be, training in the simulator for all pilots on the procedures for DME arcs and non-radar environment during AQP (Advanced Qualification Program) as a refresher. This is due to the fact of consistently being in radar contact from airport to airport in the USA, that the use of non-radar environment procedures diminishes through time with lack of use. Also, understanding that there is mountainous terrain in the cities we go to in Mexico, there needs to be at least a better radar system for aircraft vectoring as well as WX avoidance on the ground to preclude an issues with arriving in these airports. Looking back on this now, one, I should have proceeded to the hold on the MAP and tried to wait out the WX (fuel permitting) and two, I should have taken control of the aircraft the moment this first started (the first time overflying the localizer). From that day on, I have flown every leg into Mexico due to the nature of the flight environment and experience level of the FOs I have flown with.","","","","CRJ-900 Captain reported the flying First Officer demonstrated lack of proficiency while flying approaches in weather in a non-radar environment.","15000","15000",TRUE,TRUE

We had a normal push back, start-up and taxi. The initial climb out was normal and soon after 10,000 feet I began to figure out the break times for the flight. I could see weather ahead on the Captain's radar and knew we would have to deviate right, which we did. It was extremely difficult to get a word in on the radio, but FO was able to get a turn from approximately 060 degrees to heading 090. It soon became obvious we would need more of a deviation to stay out of the weather. FO repeatedly tried to get a further deviation. There was constant chatter on the frequency and we were not able to get a further vector so Captain elected to turn further anyway. We were outside the edge of the weather when it suddenly became extremely loud in the cockpit because of, what I thought was, heavy rain. It was evident later that we were in hail, although I never saw hail. The noise from the hail/rain lasted approximately 2 minutes. It was basically a white-out during which we experienced severe turbulence for maybe 10 seconds. During the turbulence at FL210 we got an altitude warning. I am not sure how far off our altitude we became. After the turbulence subsided we realized the Captain's left window was cracked and our weather radar was inoperative. We could also hear a groan/humming noise coming from the radome area. Captain told FO to tell ATC we had to return. It was decided that we would land overweight rather than dump fuel. I figured the landing distance for the overweight landing and determined the departure runway was sufficient. FB (Relief Officer) called Dispatch and Operations to inform them we were on our way back. Captain landed gently and used most of the runway to slow. We exited the runway and stopped the airplane. We did not set the brakes. It was difficult for ground control to understand we needed the brakes to be checked for overheating. Eventually, they understood and asked us to shut down the engines so the inspection could be made. After the inspection we were towed to a hardstand where we were met by station personnel. The passengers and crew were able to exit the airplane via airstairs.","","B787 flight crew encountered a thunderstorm at FL210 during departure.

After being handed off from Anchorage Center to Fairbanks Approach, I contacted Fairbanks approach and checked on with my call sign and altitude and I that I had received the ATIS information for Ladd Army Airfield. I advised Fairbanks Approach that I would be requesting a Visual approach to Ladd Army Air Field. I requested a lower altitude was given a clearance to descend to 4,000 Ft (may have actually been 4,300 ft.). When I arrived at the assigned altitude my forward visibility was estimated at 4 to 5 miles at my current altitude. However my visibility was somewhat obscured due to the moderate rain shower I was flying through. My forward visibility was also reduced by the rain hitting my windshield. I was subsequently advised by Fairbanks approach that I had same direction traffic. A VFR Cessna, 3 miles at my 12 o'clock position. I noticed on my TCAS screen confirmed the traffic. I asked if the traffic was for Ladd Army Airfield. The controller confirmed this. Shortly after receiving the confirmation, the Cessna dropped off my TCAS screen. I decided to cancel IFR and requested traffic advisories to Ladd Field. After a minute of two I was handed off to Ladd Tower. I thought it odd because the Ladd Tower had closed. I remembered thinking the controller meant to contact Ladd Tower Frequency for Common traffic advisories. I switched to 125.0 (Ladd tower frequency) I heard the Cessna entering the Ladd traffic pattern for RW 25R at about the same time I believed I had the Ladd Airfield in sight and I advised the Cessna of my position. The Cessna indicated that he would follow me for 25R so I elected to make a short approach to runway 25R. As I touched down on the Runway I became aware that I was not at Ladd field. I was horrified as I realized I landed at Fairbanks International (FAI) runway 20R. I had been on the Ladd advisory frequency advising a Cessna at a different airport about 6 miles away!!!I exited the runway at the first taxiway intersection that I could safely exit. I contacted Fairbanks Ground. I was given a phone number to call. Had I not spent so much time looking for traffic I would have noticed that I was still 6 miles from Ladd. If I would have not cancelled IFR I would have been advised distance to Ladd Field Had the Ladd Tower been open they would have advised me of my position. Mitigating circumstances:1. Visibility restricted by moderate rain shower. I could see the FAI airport at 3-4 miles however the airfield was blurred due to the rain on my windshield. The terrain and airport for Ladd Army Airfield looks very similar under the current conditions.2. The controller appeared to me to have handed me off to Ladd Field Tower (advisories) earlier than I had previous flights into the area (I assumed I was closer to Ladd Field).3. My previous experience in flying into Ladd field was just over two days. I was not as familiar with the area as I thought I was. 4. I was more concerned about traffic in front of me than monitoring my distance to Ladd field.5. The class C airspace for FAI and FBK are joined together. So when I was instructed to call the tower it may be that that tower was meant to be Fairbanks Tower. If the controller slipped and just said 'contact the tower' or 'contact Ladd tower' or 'Fairbanks tower;' even if the tower specified was not clear; it just seems to me that the controller should cite the frequency I.E. contact Ladd Tower 125.0 or Fairbanks tower 118.3. Especially when 2 Class C airspace airports are joined with common airport traffic area boundary. The addition to the controller giving frequency after the name of the tower should make it less likely for pilots to switch to the wrong tower frequency.What changes I made since this incident:I will no longer fly into a busy airport environment under VFR flight rules. I will always stayon my IFR flight plan until after either and instrument approach or a visual approach has resulted in landing at the airport of intended landing.

We departed for MDW an hour late, due to MDW forecast for T-Storms and frontal passage. About 15 minutes from landing, the front was about 15 miles away to the north. We were being vectored onto RWY 22L on a NW HDG. ATC put a Company jet between us and another Company approximately 10 miles ahead. To get spacing, they gave us direct STERE (a northerly HDG) and clearance for the approach. Storms were still N of our position and N of STERE by about 7 and 4 miles respectfully.Within about 30 seconds, we started experiencing moderate turbulence and windshear. I told the FO to turn and told ATC we needed a turn. It was granted. In the turn away from weather, we got severe turbulence, to include violent abrupt yaw moments, airspeed flux of 30-40 knots, and bank angles in excess of 45 degrees. ATC gave us an airspeed of 210 or less. I said 'unable.' We had altitude deviation of 500 feet. We escaped to the SW and paralleled the approach course.After it smoothed out, we attempted to reacquire the approach course just south of downtown Chicago. We experienced a very strong updraft. Concerned it would be followed by a downdraft and well above glidepath, we went around to the south. ATC gave us vectors to a visual downwind for another attempt. After switching to Tower, and on base, Tower reported a windshear alert of 35 knots on final. We decided to go around since we were again experiencing large wind shifts. We diverted to our alternate.What disappointed me also was the lack of credibility our pilots in following aircraft put in our report. Two airplanes behind us continued on a similar path; we were just a minute or two before them. They also experienced severe turbulence. After hearing that behind us, I told Chicago Approach, that no other planes should be allowed to fly through that.It was the worst turbulence I had experienced in my flying experience of [over two decades]. Aircraft control was lost for certain periods of time and our other pilots decided it was okay to fly into that. We obviously were not able to maintain our assigned clearance due to the turbulence. We were unable to maintain the assigned course, altitude, or airspeed. The weather center needs to real-time update weather holds for current radar conditions to not place jets in greater danger. Our pilots need to listen up and wise up, and trust Company Pilot reports.","","","","An air carrier on approach to MDW encountered severe turbulence with momentary losses of control.

We were assigned a speed of 170 and had flaps 20 selected. Once inside the thunderstorm we encountered severe wind shear with lightning all around us (don't know if we were hit). The airspeed must have fluctuated almost a 100 kts and we went several times from stick shaker into overspeed by about 20 +/- with bank angle up to 40-45 degrees while in a turn on autopilot out of the thunderstorm cell. We could not maintain the assigned speed due to the severe wind shear airspeed fluctuations. Several times we had to advance full pwr (Power) to keep the speed out of the stick shaker. We did not want to do a wind shear escape maneuver to avoid flying deeper into the cell. We could see the clear area ahead of us on the nav (Navigation) display hence we decided to keep turning and after 10 to 20 seconds we were out of it. We wrote up the overspeed (10-20kts) for the selected flap setting of 20 degrees and possible lightning strikes.We asked the Controller to give us a right turn in less than 2 miles but she turned us just about a mile or 2 too late. Approach in the clear and landing were uneventful.  The flight in front of us must have encountered similar weather and told ATC not to let anybody go as far on the downwind.

Upon being given 170 knots, and a descent to 4000 from 5000, we initiated a base turn, upon entering a strong cell, the aircraft encountered a severe drop in altitude, followed immediately by an updraft, severe airspeed fluctuations going from stick shaker to overspeed were instantaneous. Aircraft went to approx 40 deg of bank. Throttles were overridden in order to not chase airspeed, executing a wind shear maneuver per se would have exacerbated the situation, as we need to continue our turn to escape the cell. Airspeed exceeded the flaps 20 limitation by approximately 10-20 knots. Aircraft flew out of the cell, continued the approach visually, with no further discrepancies. Encroaching weather system, and the lack of ATC foreseeing the need to close off the downwind. Better ATC flow control with given weather conditions. They were extending the downwind into the weather, by allowing several aircraft requesting close in base turn, and approving their request. Several crews advised ATC to not let any aircraft go where they had been.

Notified by Tower approaching 1000 feet of abrupt wind shift which would give us a 17 knot tailwind. The airplane in position on the runway requested the winds again and decided not to launch. We realized the winds were out of limits for our approach, and notified tower around 1000 feet AGL of our intention to go around. Tower said that we didn't need to do that, but just to climb to 2500 feet and continue, but go around was already initiated using TOGA levers. The pilot monitoring was changing the altitude from the 3500 feet we had previously set for a visual missed to 2500 feet as assigned as I was trying to hit altitude hold. Signals got crossed and I elected to hand fly as the airplane was now climbing quite rapidly. There was some confusion on the radio as to what heading we were to fly and how the controller wanted us to return to land in the opposite direction, and the distraction of trying to get the airplane out of [go around] mode (heading select) led to an overshoot of 500 feet on the level off. We were VMC with no separation issues, and Tower did not comment except to clear us back down to 2500 feet. The Tower Controller was then pushing us to initiate a teardrop or switch back to approach for an extended downwind. PM asked for a 6 mile final, but even after we reconfigured quickly with maximum drag, we were just barely stable at 500 feet for the landing. We realized after landing that the approach speeds were not reset for the higher wind component (17 knots) on final.Expectation bias on the initial missed approach. I was thinking about a normal go around, but the Controller wanted us to perform a discontinued approach. We were already throttled up and climbing when the controller asked us to level off at a lower altitude. Too many hands were working the glare shield controls [MCP] at once, and altitude hold was not selected in a timely manner. Hand flying was then the best option, but I lost situational awareness when the conversation became about heading and missed the level off. We then let ourselves be talked into a shorter approach than we wanted after the missed approach, causing us to feel rushed to land.Decide on a course of action and stick with it. If it's going to be a normal go around, then do that. If it's going to be a discontinued approach, then make it clear to the other crewmember who will be pushing the buttons.

We were passing north of a line of weather extending from COT to past Houston. After passing SAT, were given a turn back towards the south and handed over to the previous center controller. The line of weather was approximately 40 miles to the south of our position. The pilot flying (PF) and I agreed we would quickly need a turn. The controller cleared us to deviate right of course and proceed direct CRP when able. I expected to be turned back towards Houston. Rather, were being given a clearance through the weather. I asked the controller for a route to Houston that didn't involve flying through the worst part of the line. He responded that we could proceed direct COT direct CRP. The PF and I agreed that at least that would keep us out of the weather and give us time to coordinate with dispatch. Also, that route would provide us with many airports to divert to if necessary. We discussed the different options we had as I sent an update through ACARS to dispatch.Approaching COT, there were a few small cells painting on the radar at our 10 o'clock at 25 miles. Since we had been cleared to COT and to deviate as necessary, I assumed the PF was planning on going around the western edge of the weather and then we would continue on our assigned route to CRP. While it was partially imbedded, I could see the base of a smaller towering cumulus (TCU) in front of us over COT. I was also painting it on weather radar. We were in the clear and the ride was smooth. I told the PF that we needed to come farther to the right to avoid the weather in front of us. He disagreed with me and said he was beginning the turn towards the southeast. There was a clear opening in the line but there was quite a bit of blowoff which I think prevented the PF from seeing the TCU in front of us. I did not realize this at the time, but I think the PF's radar may have been angled up too high and he was only seeing the taller cells. Instead of turning right and staying in the clear as I expected, we turned left. I think he thought the weather that I was painting was farther away from us than it really was (the radar range on my display was set to 25 miles while his was at 50.) I called the flight attendant to make sure that he and the passengers were seated.The PF had the airplane slowing as we encountered severe turbulence for approximately 10 seconds. I believe that we flew through the edge of the very top of a cell which was obscured. The airplane gained about 3 hundred feet of altitude and rolled approximately 20 degrees. The autopilot disconnected and the PF had hold of the controls. We were able to quickly return the FL370.We quickly exited the weather as the part we had passed through was only about 10 miles wide (the far western edge of it.) We checked with the flight attendant to make sure that no one had been injured. He said everyone was fine. I reported the severe turbulence to ATC. We also reported our encounter to dispatch.I believe that during the turbulence we encountered super cooled droplets and the airframe picked up ice on unprotected areas of the fuselage. We did have a wing anti-ice failure which we cleared using the QRH procedure. Later on, during the descent and passing through more icing we received an ice detector 2 fail message. We followed the QRH procedure for that as well. The plane was performing as if there was ice buildup on the fuselage and we could see ice on the nose. The wing leading edges appeared free of ice. We were fairly confident that any ice on the plane would melt before the approach due to warm temperatures on the ground in Houston. Additionally, we had gotten the wing anti ice failure message to clear. We ran the QRH for loss of anti-icing in icing conditions. If unsure that ice has been cleared from the wings and tail, it calls for a flaps 22 landing with an increased approach speed. In case the updrafts and a super cooled droplets had put ice on unprotected areas of the wings, flaps, and tail, we decided to follow this part of the procedure.Passing through 15,000 we could see ice coming off the nose and the aircraft seemed to lose some drag and was flying normally. We still elected to land flaps 22 per the QRH procedure. The severe turbulence and anti-icing system failures were written in the aircraft logbook and reported to maintenance control.The aircraft encountered severe turbulence and super cooled droplets which attached to parts of the airframe. Additionally we deviated 300 feet from our assigned altitude. Threats included the weather and changes to ATC routing into Houston. We may have had an error in our use of weather radar. There was an error in judgment in choosing to fly too close to the weather.Requesting plans stated from the PF is crucial for shared mental model. If I had more warning that he intended to turn just before COT, we would have had more time to come up with a better plan together. Plans stated could have avoided that situation in the first place. For example, 'We are going to go all the way around the west side of the cells and if either of us thinks we should do otherwise, we'll both agree to it first.' Time to discuss would have allowed us to trap the error in tilt management of the radar.I wish that I had asserted myself more quickly. It was clearly not our intention to fly too close to the thunderstorms and TCU. We were not experiencing any pressure to hurry to Houston. The PF thought the clouds in this area were merely blow off and didn't expect anything to be embedded in it. He was not expecting us to encounter severe turbulence.","","After the turbulence encounter, we then encountered a significant amount of freezing precipitation during the descent into IAH. During this encounter the aircraft performance was reduced as far as our ability to hold airspeed while the thrust levers where in the detent, with cruise power selected. We were able to successfully shed the ice by seeking out warmer air, while keeping our airspeed high, to have the highest Total Air Temperature as possible. While this is happening we received a Wing Anti-ICE failure and an Ice detector 2 failure, and Ice condition anti-ice inoperative EICAS messages. Using the QRH for the anti-ice failure we were unable to clear the message. Due to this we continued with the QRH anti ice condition with the anti ice inoperative all the way to a successful landing.The threats on this flight were the turbulence, followed by the severe icing, all while deviating around significant weather with multiple ATC re-routes. All of this kept us very busy while troubleshooting and running the QRH checklists. To summarize, our workload was extremely high.Regarding the turbulence encounter; I felt we handled the turbulence very well. While I was hand flying the aircraft the FO and I were able to easily communicate with the FA, and he did a great job making sure the passengers were seated while we were deviating around the weather with the multiple ATC re-routes. Our FA also followed our instructions to sit in his jump seat during the turbulence. MY FO also did a great job of communicating with ATC during the event. All of this made it very easy for me to concentrate on keeping the aircraft under control and returning it to the assigned altitude quickly and as smooth as possible.This was the first time I have encountered turbulence of this severity, and I felt it was very similar to what I have seen during our simulator training. I am very thankful to have had those experiences prior to the real life encounter. We need to continue to train this way, and make every effort to keep the experiences fresh. During our encounter with the severe icing we had multiple EICAS messages related to the anti ice failure. It was difficult to manage that with also dealing with the constant ATC re-routing for all the weather in the Houston area that morning. It would seemingly be impossible to prevent that situation again from happening, but I felt all of us as a crew (working as a crew), our capacity to handle this multifaceted situation was appropriate.","","EMB145 flight crew experienced severe turbulence en route to Houston at FL370 while deviating around thunderstorms, which the First Officer believed were avoidable. He also believed they encountered super cooled water droplets and the airframe picked up ice on unprotected areas of the fuselage.

The encounter was brief and sudden, with two sudden 'jolts' of turbulence, then mostly light chop during the mountain wave which affected the aircraft a further 2 minutes or so. The autopilot and autothrottles remained engaged throughout the event, although manual power control was necessary to remain at a safe airspeed.Occasional MDT turbulence was forecast along our offshore route and we had made several altitude changes in the previous twenty minutes to find smoother air, helped out by reports from several other flights ahead of us bound for SECL. Occasional MDT turbulence and Occasional MDT mountain wave were also forecast in the immediate area of the encounter, however no other traffic had reported turbulence activity eastbound. Although we had been in smooth air for approximately five minutes prior to the encounter, the seat belt sign was illuminated due to the forecast.Immediately prior to the event we were at 295,000 LBS Gross weight and Mach .815. The captain was in the cabin in the crew rest seat. The event occurred while eastbound near REPEV on UL560, near the crux of the Andes mountain range.After the event, the cabin crew reported that service items had been displace to the floor and one Flight Attendant (FA) had hot coffee spilled on him and possibly burned.

This clearance was only a partial clearance, and I did not accept it due to it not being a complete clearance. I told the controller we needed a complete clearance or he needed to give us a holding clearance. After that he responded with, 'you can't take (EFC) clearances', 'expect the rest of the clearance from the next guy', 'Ive never heard of that'. The clearance he gave us was from YQO to VHP with no other fix. I told him we needed a complete full route clearance so we know what to do in case of lost communications. He then issued us YQO, VHP, direct ORD.  That situation seemed to solve itself by us not accepting the partial clearance.  We then received two more re-routes to ORD and ended up holding over WEEVR intersection. Prior to hitting our BINGO fuel we were further given a clearance of direct VHP SPI PNT TRTLL2 ORD. This clearance was unacceptable as we didn't anywhere close to the amount of fuel needed to accept the route. As this is all happening the dispatcher is communicating the position of the weather very well to us using familiar fix's on ORD arrivals as well as where new cells were 'blowing up'...this was incredibly helpful as the weather review the First Officer and I had done prior to this flight as well as the vantage point we had during the hold which allowed us to scan what seemed like the entire upper Midwest with our aircraft's radar showed that the storms where building in front of the strong cold front.  During all of this discussion the release was amended to show MKE as our new alternate. This was a very good choice as at that time MKE was behind the line of weather and the cold front was almost completely moved through the area. Further discussion between myself and the First Officer was that should a diversion happen we decided to only go to any airport that would allow us to descend behind the line of weather (on the west side), and also be west of the front. We agreed and planned for a diversion to MKE. This decision was also communicated to dispatch. Our dispatcher was very helpful during this phase of the flight, providing very timely communication about the weather and responding to a lot of ACARS text messages. After requesting ATC to see if they could further cut our route, they stuck to the (VHP SPI PNT TRTLL2 ORD) route. I then notified ATC we would be changing our destination to MKE. ATC then responded very quickly to question this choice. ATC suggested IND, and CVG. Although those airports were somewhat geographically closer, they were on the wrong side of the front, line of thunderstorms, and not what this crew (including dispatch) had planned for. At this point we are now getting to a situation where we will not be able to land in MKE with 45 mins of fuel. Due to this as well as what seems like ATC's inability to address our fuel concern; I elected to declare [minimum] fuel, and stated we would need to head to MKE.While en route to MKE, ATC asked us if we would be able to accept going to ORD. I said we would but we would need priority to land, and no further delays. We then amended the release again via ACARS to show ORD as our destination. It then seemed as though ATC wanted us to cancel our status. They asked us twice for this, and were very unusual requests. Due to our fuel level at the time of those requests we would not have been able to attempt a landing in ORD, go missed, then attempt a landing in MKE, go missed, and still have anything close to 45 mins of fuel with the weather and amount of traffic going into ORD and MKE at that time.  I made it clear were not going to cancel our status and we continued to fly a visual approach to runway 28C, with a normal landing. We landed with 2700lbs of fuel.","","","","After several reroutes and holding, the crew declared minimum fuel but were able to land at their original destination of ORD instead of diverting.","36000","36000",TRUE,TRUE

I was nearly finished with cabin service. I had just served row 15. I locked the cart and attempted service on row 16, so the cart was approximately between rows 17 and 18. Turbulence struck, and I grabbed the seat handles and squatted down. I was not prepared because the Captain never informed us. I thought it was over so I tried to stand up, but I couldn't. A few seconds passed and the plane dropped drastically causing the cart to hit the top of the plane. All contents on top of the cart were off and scattered on the floor of the cabin.  Contents included, two large full bottles of water, a coffee pot, a sleeve of cold cups and a sleeve of hot cups and a caddy (sugar, tea, napkins, stir sticks). After it passed, I remained on the floor because I felt really lightheaded and unsteady. I completely lost my hearing while the incident was occurring. The only thing I heard was the cart hitting the ceiling. I only realized this when the forward FA said she yelled at me to ask if I was ok, and I never heard her. She commented that everyone was screaming very loudly. I didn't hear anything or anyone until I was able to stand up. I was worried about the forward FA, as she was in pain. The turbulence had hurt her shoulder. My neck was sore, but I was able to complete my tasks. A passenger in row 18 said that she never knew the importance of wearing her seatbelt until that occurrence.The forward FA and I checked on all the passengers and asked each one 'if they were alright.' Everyone that had a drink, was wearing it. My cart was a mess. I took the cart back to the galley and the drawers were all jammed. I set the cart back up and serviced everyone again. We kept the aircraft for the next flight and upon setting up the cart for service, we realized that the metal flap that folds out, fell off. So damage was done to the cart. The pilots checked the ceiling and no damage was done.Turbulence happens on almost every flight, and the severity depends on the type of turbulence encountered. On said flight, it was severe turbulence. The cart was thrown up and hit the ceiling aircraft. Turbulence happened, and the FAs were not prepared because no warning was given from the Captain. After the initial shock wore off, the Forward FA and I checked on each passenger. No one was injured. One lady complained to her about her neck. The forward FA gave the lady an ice bag and asked her if she needed an ambulance to meet us at gate, but lady said she was ok.After we landed and deplaned, we questioned the flight crew. We asked them why they didn't call us and give us a heads up on the weather. Their response was that they were busy trying to get out of the storm. They gave excuses such as ATC wasn't communicating with them and that basically they were too busy to communicate with us. One had commented that at one point they lost auto pilot. He commented that if they had taken the time to call and let us know that we wouldn't be having a conversation at all. They were so engrossed in keeping us out of the storm, that they couldn't call us and let us know that we were going into a storm. However, I am disappointed with the lack of communication.","","","","CRJ900 Flight Attendant described an unexpected encounter with severe turbulence during beverage service.

Prior to takeoff, I had informed Morristown Ground of my request: Take off MMU, proceed to EWR direct, transition Class B airspace to the Statue of Liberty, remain in the Class B up the Hudson River. I have performed this routing at least 4 times prior to this instance without incident. Morristown Tower handed me off to Newark Tower. I believe at that point EWR Tower told me to remain clear of the New York Class B. My altitude was 1,500 feet MSL, and I had adjusted to EWR's Altimeter Setting. I was approximately 7 NM out on a 270 radial from the EWR tower, essentially perpendicular to the main runway alignment. I was given a Bravo clearance and told to aim for the EWR Tower. From this point on, I would usually be given Vectors to overfly the approach end of the Runway in use and proceed towards the Statue (this is located midfield). However, this is where this occurrence deviated from what I was used to. I was told to proceed South at approximately 3 NM out, now parallel to the main Runway alignment. When I was abeam the Runway 4 numbers, the Tower instructed me to 'Proceed on Course, overfly the 22 Numbers and remain South of the Newark ATC Tower. This has been my first flight in 60 day, so while not overwhelmed, I was still 'knocking the rust off a bit'. This airspace is complex, but having done this flight multiple times previously, I had no reason to think this was too much to handle. So when I heard this instruction, my mind interpolated this information; I was already abeam the Runway 4 numbers, and the instruction was to 'remain South of the Newark tower'. I interpreted, based on where the Controller had me fly to and the instruction 'stay south of the tower' that I was on the correct flight path. Further, there was no other Local traffic other than arrivals and departures to the field, so I figured there was no reason for ATC to have me divert this far south just to fly north again. Based on this, I set up to cross over what I had assumed was the RWY 22 numbers but was actually the RWY 4 numbers. At 1 NM out on this path, the controller of course instructed me to turn Left and reiterated I was to fly over the 22 Numbers. At the same moment, I began to have some squelch issues with my headset. In this time, the controller turned me back to the North (180 turn) and I then became reoriented and realized what exactly he wanted me to do. I flew north past the tower and began to turn to cross over the RWY 22 number. I had the numbers visually and aligned toward them, but the controller said, 'You have to fly by my rules if you want to use my airspace, sir'. I was perplexed and now disoriented because I had to unscramble his instruction, and then when I finally did, he still corrected me. He told me to run back out to the west of the field and we would try this again. He instructed me to remain 'At or Below 1500' which I thought was an odd request considering there was a heavy commercial traffic arriving and departing the field. There was some moderate chop, so I decided to stay at 1,300 as to give myself some room in case I hit some updrafts in order to respect his altitude instruction. Again, I was now reoriented to cross the RWY 22 number, he cleared me to do so. Overhead the field, he told me that my altitude indicated 1,200 and that if I wanted to fly in his airspace I need to learn how to keep Altitude. I responded with a compliant, 'yes sir' so as to not trigger any spiteful action like rerouting or even investigation, as I felt that wasn't too far away. Just before I was handed off to LGA tower, I heard a similar incident transpire in which this controller was having an interpersonal issue with what I believe was a helo doing some photo work. This controller was disorientingly unclear in his instruction which he followed up with curt ambiguous reprimand. I have never had this problem before and have performed this same route at various time of day with various traffic flow and have never experienced this. I couldn't help but feel that the routing to the south of the field only to proceed North again then make a 35 degree bank to shoot his desired track of between Runway 11-29 and the tower was just an action to discourage VFR traffic and make it known I was not welcome. I am fully aware that Transition service and overflight are provided on a workload permitting basis, so just turn me away instead of posing obstacles meant to give me a bad experience. Having said that, I should have inquired further and double checked the runways to ensure what the controller said was accurate.

I am new to the Airbus and prior to this event had accumulated approximately 45 total flight hours.The Aircraft's autopilot was engaged until prior to this event.On our arrival to the Miami Airport we were given the 'HILEY SIX' arrival with crossing restrictions of 280 Knots and 13,000 feet as depicted at 'BTOGA' as depicted on the arrival. We advised Air Traffic Control that following 'BTOGA' there were storm cells over 'HILEY and KAINS' intersections and that we wanted to deviate to the west. ATC advised that that was not possible due to departure flow leaving the Miami airports.At his time ATC advised us that we were to expect the LOC 8L approach instead of the ILS 12 approach that we had preloaded into the aircraft's navigation system. With this new runway assignment, the aircraft's navigation system was reprogrammed and we briefed the approach procedures.As we finished loading and briefing the new runway, we advised that we needed to deviate from course as the storms were in our way.Initially, ATC had us flying between the build ups, and then gave us a speed restriction of 210 Knots and a descent of 11,000 to 8,000 feet. While trying to slow the aircraft down and descending, I was using the spoilers and with the VLS speed approaching our aircrafts speed, I called for Flaps 1.ATC assigned a southerly heading that would have us fly into the face of a storm, so the Captain called for an immediate autopilot off, right turn. (Of note here is that this was becoming a rough bouncy ride due to the storms that we were approaching.) I complied and made mistake of lowering the nose while turning. This resulted in a rapid acceleration of the airspeed that I failed to notice as I was visually trying to avoid the worse of the storm. At this time the aircraft's audio over speed horn sounded and the airspeed had increased to approximately 265 knots. At this time, I immediately leveled the aircraft and slowed to below flap extension speed.After arrival at the airport gate, Maintenance was notified, and the flap over speed event was documented in the maintenance log.Additionally on this LOC 8L approach, I executed a go around as I was too high and fast to be established and stable for the landing. During a turn to the north, the Captain called for the aircraft control and I was not quick enough to release my side stick and an audio dual input alert sounded.","","While encountering turbulence and deviating for large build ups, the crew experienced a flap overspeed, then was caught high and fast so executed a go-around.

The plane we were flying had a MEL that required the #2 generator be deferred.  As a result the APU had to be run continuously throughout the flight to provide electrical power.  The MEL procedure was followed and takeoff, climb, and cruise went normal like any other flight.  However during cruise we got an APU oil press caution message.  I had the controls but I transferred them and the radios to my FO (First Officer) so I could run the QRH procedure.  It was followed, and the end of the checklist directed us to land at nearest suitable airport since the APU generator was essential for flight and it couldn't be shut down.  Before the QRH was completed Approach started us on our descent into [destination].  I was in communication with dispatch about a possible diversion and potential airports that would work.  We were around 20 minutes from [destination] and already set up for the arrival and landing into there with current weather.  After starting our descent the APU oil temp caution message also appeared.  After running the QRH we still had the same agenda to continue on to [destination] and land as soon as possible.  Although we could have been to [several alternate airports] faster we could see the buildups and severe line of thunderstorms out the window and also on radar moving along the east coast.  Before each flight it's a habit of mine to check our filed flight plan route to check for any possible weather we may encounter, and I saw the mentioned thunderstorms and made a mental note.  As a result of the weather and potential suitable airports we decided to continue on instead of diverting.  After landing without incident (no emergency was declared) maintenance was called in and it was discovered that the APU oil cap had been left off by the mechanics doing an inspection on the APU.  The APU was damaged and the return flight had to be cancelled so more maintenance could be performed later that night and new parts installed.  I feel confident in my choice to continue and the dispatcher later agreed with me that the choice we made was the safest and best one possible.","","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","","CRJ-200 flight crew reported they lost the APU which was their second generator.

Such as attempting to enter 'ELP' with the result being 'ELLPPP'. This requires an attempt to delete the extra letters. However, the 'delete' key erases more than one letter and can delete the entire word. Under 'normal' operations, the flight crews have had to make this work by multiple inputs and deletes to get the desired input to the FMS. There is an aversion to 'write up' the FMS as it makes it unavailable for several days/weeks. During abnormal/diversion/missed approach conditions, the inability to enter data can lead to a pilot deviation or unsafe situation.  Such was the situation while approaching ELP airport with a thunderstorm over the field. With high wind and windshear reports and visible lightning, I asked for delay vectors as the weather cell was moving north, away from the field.  Approach was happy to comply with the following instruction: 'turn left heading 140, Hold on the ELP 140 deg radial, 15 dme, right turns, 5 mile legs'. I attempted to enter this info into the FMS several times but got worthless data on the scratch pad. I.E. EELPP1400///115 or ELPPP111440//155, etc. As we were rapidly approaching the holding fix, I had to revert to 'green needles' to display the radial and DME info. Unfortunately the First Officer was inexperienced and unable to add value to the situation other than to follow the commands I was telling him. We were late in beginning our initial turn outbound but were able to recover to the holding pattern once I gave him the DME numbers to begin the next turn.As we were in VMC conditions with the airport in sight, and only one other plane in holding below us, we were not in potential safety situation. However, this could have deteriorated quickly.  After a couple of turns in hold, we proceeded to a visual approach with no issues.Earlier this year I had a similar experience with multiple missed approaches at LAX where ATC was barking navigation fixes to proceed to. Again under stressful conditions I needed several attempts to get the correct info into the FMS.The situation with the FMS keypads is well known by the company who continue to dismiss it as nothing more than a 'nuisance issue'. In fact, I brought this topic up to the President on his first companywide conference call earlier this year.

Due to significant convective activity and associated turbulence in the southwestern U.S. we, along with other aircraft in the vicinity were experiencing light to moderate continuous turbulence, as well as thunderstorm activity along our route. In an effort to adequately avoid the thunderstorms as well as find smoother air we requested and received a block altitude of FL450-470. Shortly thereafter the issuing controller asked us if we were able to maintain FL470, as there were many aircraft deviating and looking to climb to avoid weather. We climbed to FL470 to accommodate the controller's request and cancelled the block altitude.Two sectors later... (where our problems begin). While still in cruise at FL470 we were handed off to another Denver center controller. We had just passed about 25 miles south of the last of the significant thunderstorms. We were is relatively smooth air, with light wave activity from the associated storms when the controller instructs us to descend to FL450. Being downwind of the storm activity, we were hesitant to descend and requested a vector to remain at altitude and to accommodate what we assumed was conflicting traffic. The controller then informed us that there was no traffic, but we were at the wrong altitude for direction of flight and had to descend. We found this a little ridiculous and began to argue our case with the controller who's only response was that we couldn't know the flight conditions at FL450 because we were not there and we had to descend to see if meteorological conditions then warranted our request for FL470.We acquiesced to the controller's request, began a descent and immediately entered into light increasing to moderate turbulence. The report did not satisfy the controller who reaffirmed that since we still not leveled at FL450 we could not yet return to FL470. Eventually leveling at FL450, in continuous moderate turbulence we were allowed to return to FL470 for the remainder of our flight.It bothers me that a controller working in airspace known for its hazardous weather would be so willing to disregard the reports from a flight crew in his airspace as to the current conditions, as well as ignore their requests for some reprieve to escape them. My only conclusion is that new controllers aren't receiving adequate training in meteorology as it pertains to aviation.","","","","An aircraft at FL470 avoiding weather with no traffic was told to descend to FL450 for proper direction of flight. The pilots argued to remain at FL470 in smooth air, but the request was denied. In turbulence, at FL450, the crew was allowed to return to FL470.","45000, 47000","47000",FALSE,FALSE

The winds were reported at 350 at 8 gusting to 35, so we added 10 knots to our Vref speed. The approach remained stable but with some moderate turbulence all the way to the runway. As we began the flare, we encountered heavy rain conditions. Upon touchdown, reverse thrust and brakes were applied. The reverse thrust worked as usual, however, there was no braking action. I increased the brake pedal deflection to full, but the aircraft still did not respond. At this point the captain and I both realized there was an issue with the brakes, and we ran the appropriate memory items for a braking loss. I released the brakes momentarily, anti-skid was selected to off, and brakes were reapplied. Unfortunately, there was still no response from the brakes. The captain then manually selected the spoilers to full. Both the captain and I continued to apply full brake pedal deflection and maximum reverse thrust until we were sure that we were going to stop. The aircraft gradually slowed and we were able to make the turn off at taxiway C11. The anti-skid was selected back to ON after we stopped. Braking action was adequate for the very short taxi into the ramp. We got an A/SKID OUTBD caution message and an OB GND SPLR FAULT status message sometime during the landing roll. These messages persisted even after shutting down the aircraft. The captain wrote up these messages and contacted maintenance. I believe that this event occurred due to an aircraft system malfunction. The braking system did not respond to pilot input on the landing roll. Aside from the EICAS messages we received, the highest BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) temperature that was displayed after the landing was a 2. If the braking system had been working, the brake temperatures would have been much higher than this after applying full brakes for a landing. Further, selecting the ANTI-SKID to OFF should have disabled the anti-skid system, which would've caused the wheels to lock up if full braking was applied at a high speed. At the very least, this would've caused bald spots on the tires. During the post-flight inspection of the tires, none of them had any unusual wear, which indicates that the brakes were not applied, even after selecting the ANTI-SKID to OFF. A contributing factor to this event was also the heavy rain/poor field conditions. However, company aircraft that landed immediately before and after us did not have issues with braking, leading me to believe that it was an aircraft specific issue. I'm reporting this event so the company is aware of the possible safety issue from a failing Anti-Skid Control Unit. I believe we as a crew acted appropriately, but there was still a reduced safety margin.","","","","During landing rollout in heavy rain, the crew of a CRJ-900 experienced an initial loss of braking action.

The warning message 'L Bleed Duct' then appeared on the EICAS, we followed standard procedures to cancel and identify, I was in control of the aircraft and have the radio, the captain referenced the EPC and QRH, which instructed us to don our oxygen mask and emergency descent to 10,000 ft. We then [advised ATC], and were given direct to airport, with vectors to final approach for visual runway XXR. Meanwhile the captain continued the procedures, and communicates with the cabin crew and company Ops. We landed normally on runway XXR, and exited to the left on taxiway, and came to a complete stop as advised from tower. The firefighters came on frequency and asked if we need to evacuate the aircraft, the captain then called the cabin crew, and we discover that cabin is filled with smoke, and I notice a faint burnt smell, we decided to emergency evacuate. We stayed onboard the aircraft and completed the evacuation and shutdown checklist. The only item we did not do on the emergency evacuation is to arm the APU, R Engine and L Engine fire squib, because everyone on board was already evacuated, firefighters are already on the scene, and we have no indication of engine fire.","","Talked to maintenance control regarding the MEL of pack, everything was fine.

[The local car rental] facility had no listed number.I decided to fly to Boulder City since the weather in the direction of Boulder City was visibly improving. I got a standard briefing and filed a flight plan with 1-800-wxbrief. Weather at Boulder City was forecast to be winds 230/04, visibility 10SM, 2000 scattered, 4200 scattered and 7000 overcast. There was an AIRMET of 'turbulence below 16,000 feet'. Route of flight was direct Jean/OL7, NV direct Boulder City/BVU, NV because of Class B airspace. Time enroute was 45 minutes. I asked for flight service frequencies to open my flight plan. I was given 122.4 and 122.35 for Reno Radio. I asked for a Las Vegas Approach Control frequency and was given Nellis Approach Control 118.3. I took off from Desert Rock. I immediately encountered moderate to severe turbulence. I called the three frequencies listed above with no response. I continued calling the frequencies as I proceeded south. It became obvious as I flew south that I could not fly my planned route because of clouds and turbulence. I started to fly over a ridge line on my route and was bounced around so much that my head hit the top of the cabin repeatedly and at one time the airspeed went from 90MPH to 160MPH instantly. I altered course to basically fly along the foothills as I proceeded south. I tried to find a Las Vegas Approach Control frequency on the Las Vegas Sectional chart. I was bouncing around so much I was unable to read any small print. I decided to use my GPSs to go under Class Bravo airspace and avoid Class Delta airspace at Henderson Executive/HND, NV. In my opinion that is what I did. I landed at Boulder City and taxied to the fuel pump. One of the line crew handed me a note to call the Las Vegas TRACON. I called and was told that I had 'Busted Class B airspace'. I told him I thought I had flown under it. He did not ask me about any of the difficulties outlined above. I did advise him that I had tried to contact Nellis Approach Control on 118.3 with no response. (This was the frequency given me by flight service when I asked for a Las Vegas Approach control frequency-see above.) He said 'there would be an investigation'. I got a radio check on my two radios before I left the fuel pump. Both checked OK. I checked them again before I departed Boulder City [the next day]. Both checked fine again.

Just prior to CROEW, the aircraft continued to descend and I recognized it at approximately 4,700 feet; 300 feet below the crossing restriction. The PF arrested the descent and began recovering the altitude which may have exceeded 400 feet.The company has been understaffed for several months and this flight crew had an extreme schedule due to the lack of personnel. The company was notified and requested, and received, that no additional flights be added to the schedule until the staffing issue can be resolved.In addition, the flight crew should be aware and competent in the operation of the aircraft systems, situational awareness and the particular process of the VNAV operational sequences.","","","","A corporate pilot experienced a failed cockpit window and requested a descent.

During this flight I was the pilot flying and I was assisted by first officer as pilot monitoring. The conditions of the flight were daylight, clear sky, moderate wind from the west. The SFO airport was landing and departing from 28L and 28R. During the initial descent from FL280 we received ATIS and planned to execute the SERFR1 arrival followed by the Tip Toe Visual 28L. Initially we were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL240. We began the descent and were cleared to descend via the SERFR1 arrival, runway 28 transition. The bottom altitude is 4000 feet at the transition fix of MENLO per the Arrival. However the FMS was loaded to reflect an Altitude of 5000 feet at MENLO per the Tip Toe Visual approach minimum altitude. While descending our instructions were changed to Descend VIA SERFR1 except maintain 10,000. At this point we were told to expect Tip Toe visual 28L. All FMS entries were completed prior to this point and we identified that we would be continuing as briefed. Descending through 11,000 feet we were told to Descend and maintain 8000 feet. Quickly after we were instructed to expedite descent. Green FLCH was selected via the Guidance panel and speed brakes were deployed to increase the rate of descent. ATC instructed to continue descent maintain 6000 Feet, increase rate of descent. We gave the best rate down via Green FLCH and speed brakes. At 7000 feet approximately we were cleared to cross MENLO at 4000 feet (the FMS was loaded at 5000 feet per instructions that we would be cleared TIP TOE VISUAL 28L) and then Cleared for the Tip toe Visual 28L. However it was only seconds later that ATC amended the instruction yet again to add another altitude. They instructed us to cross 9 miles from the runway at 3100 feet. The Altitudes loaded into the FMS were currently, MENLO 5000/230 Knots First bridge 2500 At or above and final bridge 1800 feet. The first officer quickly read back the instruction and began trying to input a distance into the FMS so that we could identify where 9 miles would be. While he was loading the FMS and we were trying to determine the best way to identify this point the aircraft descended below 4000 feet. Because we were expediting the descent the altitude deviation was noticed immediately before 4000 feet but we were unable to arrest the descent rate until 3700 feet. Power was added and the auto pilot removed to climb the aircraft to 4000 feet. ATC was notified immediately that we were returning to our assigned altitude. A TCAS traffic advisory was presented for an aircraft at 2500 feet and 10:00 from our aircraft position. We saw traffic, were instructed to continue and returned to 4000 feet as soon as possible. I believe the aircraft crossed the MENLO intersection at 4000 feet but due to workload and task saturation I can't confirm it. The first officer also quickly finished locating the 9DME point from the runway. We Crossed this point at 3100 feet and continued to descend across the bridges at our assigned altitudes. I understand that this report will be complicated to read due to the incredible amount of altitude assignments and changes that were given. I attribute the situation that we encountered to this directly. The automation was operating correctly and I as pilot flying did fail to select VNAV to support us in our descent across the MENLO interception. However, all of these complicated instructions were given approximately 4 miles from the MENLO fix. At the assigned aircraft speed it was nearly impossible to load the FMS correctly in that short amount of time. In addition first officer did an excellent job monitoring my flying and trying to input information into the FMS, However I needed to look away to confirm his entries. I also needed to pay special attention to the entry as the first officer is still within his first 100 hours in the aircraft. Although he did an excellent job, I needed to back him up with his entry as well. Due to the short period of time, the aircraft speed and the instruction to expedite the descent, I failed to cross the MENLO intersection at the assigned altitude. In a time critical situation our communication was good. We also did our best to back each other up in our decisions. I feel like as a flight crew we did well to work together to recover our altitude and fix the problem that we encountered due to incorrect FGP usage while trying to comply with company policy. Although I feel that we failed to follow company SOP by having two pilots' heads down at the same critical moment, I feel that we are also instructed to confirm FMS entries and confirm navigation plans. I know that having two pilots heads down directly lead to our failure in allowing the aircraft to descend beyond our assigned crossing altitude. However I feel that not verifying the entire into the FMS is just as dangerous. I don't know that we acted incorrectly or actually violated a company SOP, however I know the time we had was not adequate to confirm our entries as well as keep one pilot heads up. I also feel that the charting procedures for SFO airport and particularly the SERFR1 arrival and TIP TOE VISUAL 28L should be reviewed. This is a common clearance and procedure used in SFO. However the altitudes for the procedures conflict between the two charts and the FMS at the MENLO intersection. This is a HIGH WORKLOAD environment that is extremely saturated with aircraft. I also feel that SFO approach exercised extremely poor air traffic management. Completing abnormal FMS entries during a turn to final is a poor time for ATC to assign a non-routine clearance. In addition the constant changing of descent clearances makes arriving into SFO a constant challenge. SFO is nearly impossible to plan for because the clearances are changed constantly, expedite is often used and regularly you're told to expect the charted Visual approach and then cleared for the ILS during a turn to final. This is common practice in SFO. In our particular situation, the weather was beautiful and this increased general aviation traffic. The increase and locations of these VFR targets makes the approach control give the crossing restrictions in a very complicated and time critical location. After this approach to 28L we were then required to side step to another runway 28R. In such a close proximity to all these other things it is very complicated to make complicated FMS entries which are required to navigate to lateral points with vertical restrictions.","","Automation setup: auto pilot on, auto throttle on, coupled PIC side. On arrival to SFO, NorCal approach cleared us to descend and maintain FL240. The pilot flying selected FL240 in the preselect window, verified altitude restrictions as pre-loaded in the FMS and commanded a descend now VNAV descent from the autopilot. SOP checklist usage and cabin announcements accomplished at appropriate time. Further clearance to descend via the SERFR1 Arrival into SFO was received. The bottom altitude of 4000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect and verified. Continuing the descent we were re cleared to descend via except maintain 10,000 feet after EPICK. 10,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then clearance was received to expedite descent and maintain 8,000 feet. FLCH green guidance was commanded with usage of speed brakes and 8,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then further clearance was received to descend maintain 6,000 feet. 6,000 feet was selected in the altitude preselect. Then further clearance was received to descend via and cleared the tiptoe visual approach to 28L cross MENLO 4,000, cross the SFO 9DME at or above 3,100 feet. 1,800 feet set in the altitude preselect with FLCH green guidance still engaged. Descending through 4,000 feet 4NM prior MENLO the First Officer verbalized the pending deviation and manipulated the flight controls through the use of the TCS button and the yolk to arrest the descent. The PIC responded immediately with a verbal confirmation of the deviation and manipulation of the flight control through use of the auto pilot disconnect button and the yolk. The altitude deviation was 300 feet down to 3700 feet before the descent could be arrested. A Traffic Advisory was sounded where a TCAS target was displayed 10 o'clock relative to aircraft position 2,500 feet below. The First Officer notified ATC of the deviation and notified again when return to 4,000 feet was accomplished. Task saturation, mismanagement of automation and a failure to crosscheck instrumentation left the aircraft in an undesirable state. I do believe a flaw of the compass procedures of setting the absolute bottom of the approach is flawed because it would only keep the aircraft on a proper descent path in magenta FMS vertical guidance. A better method would be to set the hard altitude restrictions in the altitude preselect and readjust the altitude selector once the restrictions are assured to be met.","","A flight crew cleared on the SFO SERFR ONE RNAV with multiple set down altitudes managed in Flight Level Change.

As we continued along the eastern edge of the front about 200 NM looking for a safe opening, we lost situational awareness and exceeded 50 NM offshore without life rafts on board. Around the time we finally realized that we had exceeded this limitation, we received an ATC report of an aircraft in 'moderate' turbulence experiencing a loss of 800 feet in altitude. Because a course reversal would have been well over 200 NM, and deviations westward were ill advised, I elected to exercise Captains Authority and continued along the front a little further until it was safe to turn back shoreward. Even then, we experienced continuous moderate turbulence while crossing over the line. We received a message from our Dispatcher after we became aware, reminding us not to exceed 50 NM. I replied that I was exercising Captains Authority and that it was not safe to turn eastward citing the ATC reported altitude loss event. At the most extreme, we were approximately 120 NM offshore (as we verified by our dispatcher). Given previous personal experience utilizing the old CRJ 900 waiver for 147 NM off shore without a life raft, I knew that if I remained above FL250, I would be within gliding distance of several airports along the coast. I discussed this information with the Pilot Flying and suggested that we climb from FL260 back up to FL300 to increase the safety margin.Once clear of the line, we immediately requested vectors due West (abeam Ormond Beach, OMN) to once again position ourselves no more than 50NM offshore. From that position, we requested to rejoin the new arrival at a fix that would keep us within the limitation. I never told ATC that I was exercising Captains Authority as they were extremely helpful and granted every request made without any priority handling. Had that been necessary, I would not have hesitated. I only informed the First Officer and our Dispatcher.We believed, looking at the radar, that we would be able to turn back towards our filed route with only a minor 80 NM deviation. When we were unable to find a hole along the ATC suggested heading, we should have queried ATC as to where we could expect to be able to turn back Southwesterly. Had we the plotted the closest fix, it would have been immediately evident that we were going to exceed the limitation and would have opened a discussion as to a possible diversion airport. Alternately, informing our dispatcher of our 'minor' deviation in a more timely manner would have alerted him to keep an eye on our position and he might have been able to alert us proactively and helped avoid our transgression. Also, workload permitting, and in no way relieving me of any blame for losing situational awareness, ATC could have volunteered that deviations were currently exceeding 50 NM offshore. Most regional jets do not carry life rafts and I believe that the NYC area controllers have been made aware this after several shortcuts offered along the NY/NJ coast led to similar 50 NM deviations.","","From now on, I will take more time to review the radar picture with the Captain and discuss possible scenarios that may arise. Second, whenever flying along the East Coast, I will plot VORs along the coast in the 'fix' pages of the FMS with a 50 mile ring. Tomorrow I will experiment and see if the secondary flight plan built with VORs along the coast will allow a 50 mile course offset which would effectively give a 50 mile limitation line.","","CRJ-900 flight crew reported losing situational awareness and exceeding the 50 NM from shore FAR while deviating around thunderstorms.","800, 25000, 26000, 30000","800",TRUE,FALSE

During the RNAV instrument approach procedure there were periods of moderate turbulence. At the Final Approach fix there was some moderate turbulence that became a distraction. This distraction hindered the proper completion of the pre-landing check list which in included extending the landing gear. Normally a second check on final approach is completed to insure the landing gear was down and locked. This check was not completed. A flap setting of 20 degrees was selected due to the wind conditions. The plane is equipped with two micro switches that can enable an aural gear warning sound if one or both of the switches is engaged and the gear is not down and locked. One is located on the flap control lever which is engaged if a flap setting of 25 degrees or more is selected. The other is located with the throttle and engages if the manifold pressure is below 12 inches. Because the flaps were set to 20 degrees, the associated switch would not be engaged and no warning would occur.During the landing phase of the flight extra power (above 12 inches and no gear warning) was carried until the plane was in a good position to reduce the power and land. At this point, when the power was reduced below 12 inches, the plane started to settle, the gear not locked horn signaled and the prop struck the ground. It was too late to go-round.

The aircraft was gear down and flaps 3 as we were intercepting the glide path in light turbulence with autopilot on. As we approached the glideslope intercept point, a huge radar echo appeared in front of our flightpath and ATC cancelled our approach clearance and told us to maintain 3,000 feet.

Crew discussed and requested a descent below turbulence. ATC cleared us to descend to FL290. We had turbulence throughout descent. Highest level of automation selected. VNAV SPEED descended aircraft at 2,500-3,000 FPM.I was looking at my EFB to verify proper approach was loaded in FMC and to review approach and taxi diagrams. Was having trouble reading the charts due to turbulence and lighting. At approximately FL315 we received a TCAS alert, 'traffic, monitor vertical speed.' Almost immediately followed by 'adjust vertical speed, adjust.' This caused me to look again at the automation and altitude set in MCP. Based upon our descent rate which was quite high I elected to disconnect the autopilot and autothrottles in order to comply with the alert. The aircraft was trimmed with high nose down pressure at the time of disconnect.At this time my First Officer informed me that there was traffic below us and we should probably climb. By the time I could get my bearings due to the turbulence and weather conditions (we estimated about three seconds) we then received a TCAS RA 'Climb' alert. The turbulence and weather conditions at the time of event certainly caused a distraction and brief second or two of confusion as I transitioned to the PFD guidance.I added power and reversed direction to initiate a climb. I believe we were just above FL290 when the climb was initiated. I climbed to about 30,600 feet MSL. At about FL300 I recall hearing 'clear of conflict.' I also heard (another carrier) aircraft on the arrival report to ATC that they had received a RA climb alert as well. We reported to ATC that we also had a RA climb and were leveling off. ATC advised that there was (another carrier) aircraft at FL280 and cleared us to descend back down to FL290.I alerted company Dispatch via ACARS and also called them upon landing to see if they needed more information.In hindsight after verifying that the automation was correctly set, I might have done better to first attempt responding to the TCAS alert by transitioning to MCP vertical speed to correct the problem. However, due to the turbulence and descent rate at the time of the initial alert I wasn't confident that the aircraft would capture altitude hold at our clearance limit of FL290. I now believe that turning off all automation prior to the RA climb command with the poor weather and turbulence and the nose trimmed down for a rapid descent may have compounded the problem. I also could have set a more comfortable descent rate earlier by selecting vertical speed. Once I verified the automation was properly set, I made a poor decision to focus my attention to the arrival and approach charts when I should have been monitoring my primary flight instruments. After debriefing the event with the First Officer we agreed that we were caught off guard by the changing information being provided by TCAS. In the heat of the moment I remember hearing 'adjust vertical speed, adjust' and was not confident that the aircraft would capture FL290 due to the ride conditions. I made a split-second decision to disconnect automation and this may or may not have compounded the extreme workload we were experiencing.","","At approximately FL315 we received a TCAS alert, 'traffic, monitor vertical speed.' Almost immediately followed by 'adjust vertical speed, adjust.' The Captain almost immediately disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles in order to comply with the alert.As he was doing this, I scaled down my map and mentioned the traffic is below us. As I was digesting the information I was seeing on the displays (while being bumped around quite a bit) I noticed the Captain was descending more rapidly than before the RA. It took me about two or three seconds of this before I corrected the Captain and told him we needed to climb not descend. I hesitated because I questioned myself on what I was actually seeing. As soon as I called out the error to the Captain, he corrected the attitude and complied with the RA.","","B737-700 flight crew received an RA in descent at FL315 and the Captain was a bit slow to respond.","28000, 29000, 30000, 30600, 31500, 33000","29000",TRUE,FALSE

The weather was VFR. The winds were gusting and Tower said airspeed deviations of +/- 5 knots on final and deviations of +/- 10 knots below 200 feet had been reported. The approach had moderate turbulence that increased in intensity below 200'. Airspeed was fluctuating due to the turbulence and corrections in power and descent with deviations as reported (+/- 10) but there was not a concern for the safety of the approach. Over the runway in the flare, the aircraft floated (due to wind gust) and began drifting left. The flying pilot corrected for runway alignment with crab and wing down towards the wind. I noted the right wing drop more (probably due to a large gust and/or to correction to the gust) and was concerned about excessive bank, assisted with the controls to reduce the bank as we touched down on the runway. The landing was firm but there was no thought that the wing had struck the runway and we taxied normally off the runway and to the gate.

In retrospect, if we had known the turbulence was going to be that bad at the runway, I should have flown the approach because I have more experience in the aircraft.

We were then assigned to cross a fix at so many miles at an altitude assigned by ATC. (I don't want to list what the specific fix and altitude were because I cannot remember with 100% accuracy due to the time between knowledge of possible deviation and actual occurrence). Due to the aircraft's previous Bleed 2 failures that had been occurring during decent to low altitudes, (and had been written up on a previous leg) I missed the initial PNF ATC clearance readback while I was monitoring the aircrafts systems. (The aircraft was subsequently written upon our arrival to SNA for just that problem and a full CMC download was required). I then asked the PNF what the instructions were and told him I had missed them because I had been checking the synoptic page, He told me and I set the Altitude the PNF heard, and repeated to me, into the [flight computer], I then set the crossing restriction into the flight plan's ATK feature and initiated a VNAV descent via the autopilot. That controller then handed us off to the next controller. During the check on with the new controller I heard the PNF read back the altitude we had set in the [flight computer] and the crossing restriction and heard NO correction from that controller.During the descent it became apparent to me that due to the terrain and geography of the area, the assigned altitude seemed excessively low, and the situation raised a red flag in my head. As a precaution I immediately initiated a level off and began a climb while simultaneously asking the PNF to verify that the assigned altitude was correct for this area.  The controller told us 'negative' and to climb and maintain 13,000 ft.  Which we immediately did. At no time did the controller tell us we were below our assigned altitude nor did they issue any other warnings. It was only by PIC action that a correction took place. I took the comms to query ATC as to what had happened and the controlled seemed completely unsure. I believe he asked what we had been assigned and said he would check with the previous controller. When he finally came back to us he simply proceeded to hand us off to the next controller, but before switching off I asked him if this was something I needed to worry about, (a pilot deviation) or if I could be expecting a phone number? He said No, and I took that to mean that the error had been on ATCs end and would we not need to protect ourselves with a NASA report.  At no time were we ever told we had deviated from an assigned altitude or clearance, and because the controller told us we shouldn't need to worry about a deviation, neither myself nor my co-pilot filled out a NASA report. It is due to that reason why neither of us can recollect with 100% accuracy, (on our end) what altitudes were involved. The time between the incident and time we were made aware of a possible deviation made that impossible. We do recall during the initial check on/read-back with that final controller, that the altitude and clearance was what we had in put into the FMS and AFCS respectively.I believe my first error in this event took place when I allowed myself to become distracted by the aircrafts previous CAS messages during low altitude operations and while monitoring the systems in an attempt to diagnose them, I missed the Initial ATC instructions. The other error was not asking the PNF to reconfirm the initial clearance with ATC since I had not heard it directly.  I will now be more vigilant in both areas and also will fill out a NASA form even if I am led to believe, or do not believe a deviation or safety issued but could still be possible.","","","","Phenom 100 Captain reports not hearing a descent clearance while troubleshooting a pressurization problem and asked the First Officer to repeat it, which he does, but apparently incorrectly.

Weather from DFW to SAT.  DFW SE corner post was closed due to weather.  Traffic Management Unit (TMU) play books in effect for DFW and DAL.  Restricted Area is located just north of GRK and has hot artillery shells fired in airspace.  At approximately XA:00 local time, controllers advised supervisors that said restricted area was a safety factor for deviating aircraft.  It is my belief that several aircraft deviated Restricted Area while live artillery was in use. Throughout the day Rocksprings and Austin area supervisors attempted multiple times to lower restricted area after controller requests.  Forth Worth Center supervisors also made attempts to lower restricted area. Each request to lower it was denied by Supervisor Traffic Management Unit (TMU). The S TMU's response was that all Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI's) had to be exhausted before the restricted area was lowered.  They stated that TMIs will keep all aircraft clear of restricted area. Pull the weather data all day for Stonewall and Kelly sectors, Bergstrom sector, Austin sector, Junction sector, Hicoe sector, and Dallas sector.  Any TMI issued to miss restricted area accomplishes absolutely nothing due to convective activity.  The NEXRAD data shows these sectors were saturated with convective activity.  Convective activity is extremely dynamic and it is impossible for controllers to predict exactly how aircraft will deviate.  NEXRAD data lags behind, therefore, not showing the exact location of precipitation.  NEXRAD does not show overhangs, turbulence, and thrown hail from thunderstorms.  Keep in mind the turbulence from convective activity is responsible for loss of aircraft control and the majority of injuries and deaths related to thunderstorms.  As an ex airline pilot that has deviated around thunderstorms, I can assure you that pilots deviate well beyond displayable precipitation to avoid turbulence.  Therefore it is impossible to tie aircraft down on exact routes with convective activity.  Simply put with the amount of convective activity in these sectors, issuing TMIs to avoid the restricted area is asinine.  This does not ensure aircraft will miss restricted area and may be forcing aircraft unnecessarily into a precarious situation.   The above pilot deviating knowledge was also discussed in recent crew briefings. A pilot did a crew briefing at ZHU regarding the dangers of build ups, turbulence and overhangs, all of which NEXRAD does not show.  He made very clear statements that aircraft deviate around airspace that may not actually show precipitation.  I do not understand how ZHU management passes these safety tools down to controllers but when controllers apply this knowledge on sector the Supervisory Traffic Management Coordinator (STMC) dismisses it.  The STMC, in reality, has no clue how aircraft will deviate around weather.  Let's now discuss other safety factors regarding the restricted area.  During recurrent training at ZHU we were taught the 'Swiss Cheese Model' for errors and accidents.  The model basically states that for aviation errors and accidents to occur, certain controller errors/distractions take place leading up to a potentially catastrophic event. Factors affecting sectors on this day are as follows:  -'red' sectors, extremely elevated map values-weather deviations-holding for Fort Worth Center-extremely time consuming re routes -frequency congestionRestricted Area: the controller shouldn't have had to deal with it.  The other issues were unavoidable; the restricted area could have been mitigated.  Given the above distractions, controllers made request for the restricted area to be lowered.  They were attempting to remove one of the holes in the 'Swiss Cheese Model' to avoid an error or accident. In conclusion, the STMU explained that all TMI's have to be exhausted to take back restricted area.  As stated above convective activity saturated sectors around the restricted area, there was no way for controllers to pin down aircraft to TMI's.  Therefore all TMI's were exhausted at this time.  The STMU's above statement is simply ignorant, unacceptable, and a threat to the integrity of the National Airspace (NAS).  The STMU's decision not to recall the restricted airspace put the NAS in grave danger.  Again, please keep in mind that during this time live artillery was fired in restricted area.  An individual with STMC responsibilities should be aware that aircraft do not stay established on TMIs when affected by convective activity.  Considering the above information it is disconcerting that this individual potentially jeopardized hundreds of lives.Requesting a Traffic Management Review for [this date occurrence]","","I was working [the] Traffic Management Unit (TMU) position during a large weather event day. The convective weather was present in ZFW as well as ZHU. The CQY Area was shut down for DFW and DAL arrivals, a national playbook was in effect routing the traffic that normally flows through CQY around to the north to the BYP Area and around the south through ZHU to the JEN Area. Weather was also building to the south and west of DFW inside the JEN area throughout the shift. Arrivals were having difficulties deviating around the weather in the JEN Area. The DFW airport had been shut down for arrivals numerous times, a 1st Tier Ground Stop had been issued for DFW as well as an internal ZFW Ground Stop for DFW. The airport opened and shut down several times throughout the shift. The FLM's for both the DAL and JEN Areas requested numerous times that the Restricted Area be capped at a lower altitude than 30,000 feet, and the ZHU TMU concurred. Grey Approach Control and the [military] control the Restricted Area Airspace and refused every request to cap Restricted Area. Aircraft were holding in the JEN area for the DFW stop and the JEN area Front Line manager as well as the ZFW Operations Manager both concurred this was an unsafe situation as the holding aircraft were too close to the Restricted Area airspace. This event occurred over a 6-hour period of time and should not continue.This is the second time in less than a year that Grey Approach Control and the [military] have refused to lower the cap of Restricted Area when asked for safety reasons. An aircraft deviating into Restricted Areas in a weather event is a very distinct possibility.ZHU or ZFW TMU and Operations Managers should have more say when a weather event occurs to ensure the safe and expeditious flow of traffic around the area. The Letter Of Agreement controlling the Restricted Area needs to be amended to give the option to ZFW and ZHU to cap the Restricted Area in a reasonable (30 minutes to 1 hour) amount of time to ensure aircraft can safely avoid the area.","","During a busy air traffic period a Military Restricted Area was in use. There were numerous weather deviations and Air traffic Management did not attempt to get approval from the military authorities to let air traffic transit the Restricted Areas due to weather deviations. One of the reporters believes several aircraft entered the Restricted Areas deviating for weather.","30000","30000",TRUE,TRUE

We discussed the MEL which stated that the aircraft was airworthy and capable of operating in RVSM and RNAV scenarios. During the flight we received clearance via the SOCKK TWO RNAV arrival. Before reaching GUTZZ intersection we received direct KIILO, and approximately 20 NM from KIILO we received a 'descend via' clearance for the SOCKK TWO arrival. Due to the speed restriction given to us of 270 and the late descend via clearance we determined that we 'might be a little high' at KIILO. I informed ATC (Fort Worth center) and we received clearance to be high at KIILO as long as we maintained 270 KTS. We maintained 270 and made the altitudes listed at KIILO. It is around this time that the Fort Worth center controller gave us a left turn for spacing. The captain then advised the controller of our current MEL and that we would have to disconnect the autopilot to make the turn, and therefore be unable to continue the RNAV arrival. The Fort Worth Controller then cleared us to stay on the arrival and maintain 230 KTS. We were then handed off the Regional Approach control. We checked in with Regional Approach control and were issued a speed reduction to 210 KTS, a descent to 6,000 MSL and a left turn. The captain then reiterated our MEL and that if we took the turn we would have to disconnect the autopilot and would be unable to continue the RNAV arrival. The controller acknowledged the issue, and issued the turn again, at which point we immediately disconnected the autopilot and made the turn to the assigned heading. Shortly after which the Regional Approach controller advised us of a 'Possible Pilot Deviation' and we copied a phone number down. We complied with each altitude and speed restriction given to us during the flight and landed the aircraft without further incident.I believe this was a miscommunication/ misunderstanding with Air Traffic Control and ourselves. Better communication of current aircraft operational limitations with Air Traffic Control, and possibly more understanding of company operational limitations by Air Traffic Control could easily prevent this situation from reoccurring.","","WE were descending on the SOCKK2 into DFW and was cleared to KIILO intersection with altitude relief until BOOVE, but given 280 knots or less and was doing 270 knots. At some point around KYSSS intersection ATC asked us to make a left for spacing. My first officer initially responded 'unable'. I took the radio call and explained that we have an MEL that is operationally limiting the aircraft. Advised that we can take the turn, but that would require the autopilot to come off and then we would no longer be able to continue on the RNAV arrival. ATC then advised to stay on the SOCKK2 and slow to 230 knots and we complied. Next controller issued a left to us prior to BOOVE intersection. Advised controller of same issue and he stated he understood and needed the turn for spacing. Autopilot was turned off, made turn and continued with vectors. We were advised by ATC to copy a phone number for pilot deviation. Once at the gate, I called the number and was advised they will be investigating the incident. I stated my case with the person on the phone and asked for all tapes to be saved and a copy for myself. Was given a phone number to their Quality Assurance manager and told he would be in touch with me.This was due to a poor MEL. The write up was for the heading bug and the MEL was for flight director modes. Poor guidelines given on the MEL. Please refer to MEL 22-10-02. I did not know or understand what this MEL was actually referencing by the MEL itself. Once airborne we needed a vector for weather and put the aircraft in Heading mode and realized that the Heading bug was not functioning properly. We could not turn the aircraft to a specific head using the Heading bug. In no way did this MEL address this issue. Once on the ground I called MX and advised that this aircraft should not be flown until fixed and they agreed.","","CRJ900 Flight Crew reported being dispatched with MEL 22-10-02 for the heading bug not controlling the autopilot. This became an issue during the arrival when ATC issued a heading and the crew informed them the autopilot must be turned off to comply and they could no longer fly the RNAV arrival. ATC issued the heading again then asked the crew to copy a phone number for a possible pilot deviation.","","",FALSE,FALSE

Then moderate turbulence I told Flight Attendants (FAs) to be seated.  Made a PA about suspending service, changed Altitude to FL310, better ride for 5 minutes, Changed Altitude again to FL290, reduced IAS to 290. Then to descended to FL270. Finally found a smooth ride, waited 5 minutes, called the FAs, told them that I was going to keep the Seat belt sign on, but it should be ok for them to start moving in the galley, don't bring the carts out the aisle yet and see where this ride will go.  Almost 5 minutes later we encountered moderate Turbulence for 5-10 seconds, then 30 Seconds of severe turbulence, followed by 1 minute of moderate turbulence, commanded the FAs to take their jumpseats over the PA. We were able to get a lower altitude of FL250, Aircraft (AC) was stable called the Purser to find out if everyone was alright. She explained that all the Passengers were down and ok, but that [a flight attendant] had injured his knee, wrist and bumped his head, and that [another flight attendant] hurt his Ribs and maybe back.  I talked to them about deviating or to ask if there was, any medical personnel on board who could help evaluate them, we decided to continue on.  They all agreed to continue, but to have EMTs meet the AC [at destination], to help evaluate them, and see the extent of injury and go to clinic or hospital if necessary. Notified Dispatch with multiple messages, while notifying Dispatch of our situation and notifying [medical services] for us, while relaying the info, got messages from [Company] Flt. ops manger, [flight operations], Ops manager in ORD, and [maintenance] about the Severe Turbulence, asking if I referenced the Quick reference Guide (QRG) yet for the Turbulence action guide.  All the while sending multiple messages asking the names, file number then age of my FAs, info that is readily available to them, while we were managing the AC for the remainder of the flight. Because REMF at FL250 was showing about 3.2 thousand pounds. Not a very safe option. To many messages about info that they already had if they just took a moment to think about the messages I sent to dispatch. Also, trying to get better information from ATC as far as rides went was difficult, because each controller had a different story as far as rides and altitude. 10-15 later I made a PA to the Passengers about what happened and that the AC was fine and my FAs had been banged up a little, but we were going to continue on.Approximately 20-30 minutes later I talked to the FAs again to make sure they were alright, and explained to them what happened on our end and the messages sent. Then I asked if they were really ok, because I explained to them that they were running on adrenaline, and might not feel yet, but if things change please let us know. So we continued to MCO. P.S. Original flight had us at FL310 Climbing to FL350 through that area, with a Flight Plan REMF of 6,000 pounds.","","We took off at XA:00. We were planned at FL310 until WEEDS and leveled off there. We were supposed to later climb to 350 then 370. At that time we turned off the fasten belts sign off and were discussing the forecasted turbulence ahead. As we switched frequencies we would inquire on the rides. As we flew farther east we started to hear reports of bad rides above us. We passed WEEDS and decided to stay at 310. One sector reported rides from 340-390 were getting moderate and 330-290 were light. We turned on the fasten belts sign and I believe at some point we climbed to 330. At some point the turbulence started and he told the flight attendants to secure all carts and be seated. We then encountered moderate and even just a few seconds of what I might've called severe. We reported the moderate turbulence to ATC and asked for immediate descent to 270. We had a rough ride on the way down and then everything seemed to smooth out at 270. After several minutes of smooth and maybe an occasional light ripple, he called the flight attendants and told them they could get up, but not to get any carts out. At that time there were no adverse PIREPS from other aircraft at 270 or below. I did not object to letting them up and did not question his judgment. I'd say about 3-5 minutes after that, at approximately XA:45 and 15 miles West of ICT I noticed the VSI trending into a climb and our airspeed started to increase. I recognized this as wave and began to pull the thrust back to maintain airspeed. Shortly after that the aircraft shook violently and I was thrown against my seat belt and reached up to grab the controls. The FMA showed auto throttle on, lateral mode of CWS and ALT HOLD. My best guess is the aircraft rolled about 20-30 degrees and I made the necessary control inputs to get back to wings level and then proceeded to put the plane back into LNAV/VNAV. We reported the turbulence to ATC as moderate to severe and requested a descent to 250. The severe turbulence may have lasted 30 seconds or so at the most. When everything was calm at 250 he called the back and spoke to the flight attendants. We became aware that [two flight attendants] in the aft galley had been injured and they determined they could and would like to continue to MCO. I did not hear most of the conversation, but the lead flight attendant was advocating for them to receive medical attention upon landing. We then reported the incident to dispatch and over the next hour or so answered various questions from dispatch, [flight operations] and [maintenance]. Besides being a little shaken up, the rest of the flight continued safely and normally. We eventually climbed up I believe to a maximum of 350 when we returned to smooth air well east of the forecasted and reported turbulence area to achieve a desirable REMF. We left the fasten belts sign on for the remainder of the flight. When we landed the passengers deplaned and [the injured flight attendants] were attended to by EMS in the jet bridge. Maintenance completed their inspection and we continued [on].","","The flight crew of this 737 flight, and the responsible dispatcher, reported an enroute encounter with severe turbulence. No passengers were injured. However, two flight attendants were injured but elected to continue to the destination where they received medical attention.","330, 350, 370, 6000, 25000, 27000, 29000, 31000, 33000, 35000","330",TRUE,FALSE

The warning came and went so fast I'm not sure I ever saw it on the screen, I was about to disconnect the autopilot and fully transition to a visual landing. The weather in the area was widespread rain and very windy from the southeast. There was no convective activity. It was very bumpy on the approach and just monitoring the instruments was taxing. When the windshear warning went off I honestly thought it was a gain and not a loss as I had major tunnel vision on flying the airplane. Had I not made that obvious error I would have gone around. A contributing factor to my error in judging the windshear warning was that I had flown over 8 hours that day and was a little spent. I think that if I had briefed windshear escape procedures better I would have been better prepared for a go-around, expected the go-around and thus executed the go-around when the need arose.","","","","CRJ900 First Officer experienced a momentary windshear warning at 200 feet during approach and continued to landing.

Near FL370 we were still troubleshooting when we began noticing rapidly changing differences in airspeed and altitude. We were IMC. My side began overspeeding while the FO side was 50 or 60 knots less. I turned off the autopilot and we requested a descent and [advised ATC]. We were cleared to FL240. We observed only one abnormal message on EICAS descending through about FL290, 'Interconnected Weight On Wheels Inoperative'. We followed the guidance for descending with unreliable airspeed. We agreed we needed a VFR airport to divert to. At around 10000 feet my airspeed and altitude indications rapidly returned to something more normal. We continued visually and landed. The threats are fairly obvious. I think we should have decided sooner to stop the climb, however the deviations were relatively small until the last 1000 feet or so. We [advised ATC] very quickly which helped us out as far as getting a quick decent and help from ATC locating an airport. I think that another threat may have been very little cut and dried procedures for this type of event that was clearly marked/located in the QRH.Turn the autopilot off, follow standby instruments immediately and not try to figure out which side is right or wrong. I think there should be an easy to find procedure with all the info needed in one spot for this abnormal.","","We took off with no problems. Upon passing through FL220 we noticed the aircraft not climbing very well. We were getting about 700 feet per minute in an XRJ. We talked about it and noticed the airspeeds didn't match. As we progressed, the airspeed deviations started to grow. We now turned to the QRH to seek guidance. The Captain side PFD was showing close to overspeed, while my side was showing slowing. We were now through FL360 with 1000 feet to go. The plane was stating high speed from the Captain side, but we were still slowing. We decided to [advise ATC] and started an immediate descent. I told ATC that we needed to be VFR soon as we could not trust our primary instruments. We decided on a diversion airport [that] was VFR and descended visually. Around 10,000 feet the Captain side started to respond to the blockage and things started to scroll back to their proper values.

About 15 minutes later the Captain called and said we can get up, but don't take the carts out in the aisle. I questioned the Captain, with the Purser on the phone, asking if he was saying we can get up. He said yes, so the other Flight Attendant and I started to stock the liquor cart and the food cart.

We delayed our descent to conserve fuel and landed with approximately 1,300 LBS.Unforecasted weather was the obvious threat. Also, the minimum fuel load contributed to the situation. I really can't see any errors that were made. As for the Unwanted Aircraft State (UAS), it was definitely landing at an unplanned alternate well under minimum fuel.I feel the fuel loads should be increased when flying into mountainous terrain as mountain wave can cause windshear.

At approximately 600 feet the pilots flying noticed the amber airspeed tape was bouncing around. The Pilot Flying (PF) added 5 knots to Vapproach speed for additional protection.

Immediately the PF adding power and the airplane was back to 150 knots and re-stabilized all the while the ILS was always centered on the localizer and glide slope. The PF continued the landing and the landing was uneventful touching down in the touchdown zone with normal braking and reverse. The PF made a command decision to continue the landing based on several factors. The fuel remaining was 3,700 lbs, the initial approach was thru IMS moderate turbulence and moderate icing. The PF did not want to risk making a go around back into IMC with known moderate icing and moderate turbulence with little fuel. Furthermore, ATIS and weather was calling for calm winds and what was experienced was wind shear conditions that were unpredicted and unknown.

We had slowed down to 270 as per the Operation Manual in anticipation of turbulence at the lower altitude. We also were approaching some clouds that were just around our flight altitude and I called the Flight Attendant (FA) to tell them to expect turbulence as we were about to start a decent. As soon as we got into the clouds we hit the moderate turbulence. It continued all the way through 3 thousand feet.

We were still being knocked around at that point and the First Officer (FO) and I discussed it quickly and told the A Flight Attendant to stay seated until we got lower and out of the turbulence. We leveled off and reported the moderate turbulence to ATC. We called her and told her that this was as smooth as it was going to get and to check in the back. She called back very shortly to say the B Flight Attendant was injured, and as she said it 'he's in pretty bad shape'. I wasn't sure if that meant he was unconscious or bleeding, I should have asked for more specific info. I elected to inform ATC of the medical emergency because I wanted to get the B Flight Attendant assistance as quickly as possible. We were within 20 miles of our destination and I figured that was the safest thing to do. I wasn't sure that we were through all the turbulence anyhow. We got vectors to a short final, the FO contacted the ops and told them the situation, and we were able to land within 10 minutes without further incident. The A Flight Attendant had the passengers remain seated while the EMTs arrived and attended to the B Flight Attendant. I was waiting at the flight deck door when he walked up with the EMT and walked with him up the jetway. There had been a non-rev FA in the back who helped him.

During our preflight planning we looked at weather and NOTAMs and didn't see any significant weather along route of flight except some turbulence. We pulled up an aviation weather website and saw moderate turbulence prediction for [near our route, but] it looked to be north and east of our route. We saw the jet stream had moved south. When we became airborne we started hearing PIREPS for moderate turbulence through altitudes we were transiting so we slowed to turbulence penetration speed and actually a little slower; 270 KIAS. We also heard a SIGMET for moderate turbulence. We were given an early turn off of our SID to direct to a fix on our arrival. This turn took us further south of original route. At FL240 while in the climb to cruise we experienced severe turbulence. We made a PIREP report and then determined the crew and aircraft were ok. There was no ACARS report of lateral or vertical Gs exceeded. The autopilot was on and never disconnected. After landing we made a write up in the Aircraft Maintenance Log (AML) and interviewed with maintenance followed by mandatory flight safety report.Like windshear, it's difficult to detect where turbulence will be encountered. We had also looked on our flight plan release at the tropopause windshear column for the clues that there would be turbulence on our route; shear of 10 knots or more indicate turbulence. The numbers we had didn't indicate severe turbulence. It would help pilots to have a 'picture' of the area affected; like we saw on the aviation website. But we don't have WiFi on aircraft and are busy with the task of flying and navigating. Also a direct routing clearance can take you off track from what you know about your route of flight and planning.When a SIGMET comes out, the only real help is other PIREPS given by pilots at altitude. ATC has the most updated info. If you are on a direct route it is difficult to ascertain if you are near the affected area sometimes. The iPad is a great tool but we have to know how to analyze the SIGMET quickly. So while we are flying it would be helpful if upon checking in with ATC they could tell us the threats along our route; not that turbulence was reported south of such and such VOR that we have never heard of.

Lesson: even though the schedule isn't known, you MUST grab some rest if you need it, especially with a return to IMC conditions and/or if you are fatigued. I definitely was tired looking back on the flight on the drive home.

Believing the obscuration to be associated with the low ceiling I told the flight attendants we were concerned about the lower clouds and that we were at FL270 and 109 miles from the airport and that they should clean the cabin and sit down and we would ding them again at 10,000 feet for the 10,000 feet announcement.

Just prior to the marker (SCHEL), the Tower Controller cancelled our approach clearance, told us to turn 20 degrees left and climb to 4000 feet. When switching back to the Approach Controller, he asked us if there was a reason why we slowed early and didn't maintain 180 knots to the marker. I (PF) responded with 'Nope'. The PF thought that FOM/AOM procedures say we have to be fully configured and on speed by the marker and that ATL's clearance would have him violating that. I tried to tell him that's not procedure anymore and we just have to be stabilized at 1000 feet. However, I didn't feel like that was the appropriate time to discuss who was right, so I didn't do anything to try and make him speed up.

On the preceding day, I spent several hours doing the necessary preflight preparations to assess the weather, runway lengths, and fuel options for the lengthy day. The scheduled trips involved extra attention to runway lengths, performance numbers, terrain, and passenger loads in addition to coping with less than ideal weather. With the flight plans filed and a plan of where to purchase fuel, sufficient for the performance required, I felt prepared for the upcoming day.[The night before the flight, I] did a final check of the weather. It looked like it was going to be an interesting day ahead with the remnants of a hurricane lurking on the east coast. I went to sleep feeling ready to accomplish the flights safely.[The morning of the flight] I did the entire preflight and loaded the catering before the Captain arrived. When he arrived and picked up our manifest, we discussed the weather and the difficulties of the day. At this point in time, the Captain seemed stressed and concerned as he announced that our risk assessment was in the yellow or approaching the yellow for the entire day, which I concurred with. Winds, weather, and runway length were the greatest contributors.Due to performance issues and terrain, the Captain elected to fly the [first two] legs. These legs occurred smoothly, even when weather deteriorated and we had to shoot the LDA down to minimums. I did the best I could to encourage the Captain to use the new checklist and FMS cues that are now in our manual. The Captain did not use the new procedures and preferred to use TCS instead of calling for a climb mode. Instead of requesting the Pilot Monitoring to move the knobs which is our Standard Operating Procedures, the Captain would turn the heading and yaw damp buttons for himself even after I had solicited their selection. This resistance to newly establish procedures set the tone for the rest of the legs to follow.After landing in VFR conditions and a quick turn, the Captain asked me to fly the [next] leg. At the time of departure, the winds in [destination] were less than 20kts and the ceilings were around 2000 ft, however the weather was deteriorating faster than forecasted. The flight was a short hop and my approach briefing was interrupted with a runway change that would leave us high and fast for a closer runway. Soon we were getting radar vectors for the ILS 13L approach and I was required to re-brief the approach. As the Pilot Monitoring prepared the FMS and I finished briefing the procedure, we were given a speed restriction of 180kts. During our vectors, I announced that we were too high to be capturing the glide slope based on our present position. I advised the Pilot Monitoring that we were above glideslope intercept. The weather conditions were quickly deteriorating and we were experiencing moderate turbulence and wind shear.ATC removed our speed restriction and issued a turn about 3 miles from the final approach fix. This because this was a close turn onto final, I called for the Pilot Monitoring to lower Flap/Slats 1. The Pilot Monitoring did not lower the Flaps/Slats and shook his head while saying, 'ummmmmm not yet'. As the designated Pilot Flying, I announced again, that I wanted to slow down to go down. I asked the Pilot Monitoring to verify that our speed restriction was canceled and he did not respond. I wondered why the Pilot Monitoring did not configure the aircraft right before the final approach fix. Standard Operating Procedures require the pilots to configure the aircraft before the final approach segment to ensure that the speed is stable and that the aircraft is in a safe condition for the approach and landing.At that time, ATC issued our turn onto final saying, 'maintain 2100 until established, cleared for the approach and contact tower'. For the third time, I called for Flaps/Slats 1 and requested for the gear to be extended. Instead of moving the flightcontrols, the Pilot Monitoring called the tower and set the altitude select to 2100 feet. During this entire time, the aircraft was at an acceptable speed to configure. After he was done with his radio call I asked him for the fourth time, for Flaps/Slats 1 as I began spinning the Vertical Speed knob down to catch the glideslope below us. As I was descending to capture the glideslope, the Pilot Monitoring shouted, 'you're going to be too fast.' The speed was 180 with an increasing trend, and I responded by deploying Air Brakes 1. [Our] speed stayed 180 or less while we were experiencing windshear of +/- 10-15 knots consistently. The Pilot Monitoring notes we will be too fast for the approach without configuring, and decides to respond to my four previous requests to configure the aircraft. At the same time, as the Pilot Monitoring yells, 'We're too fast,' I disengage the auto throttles and retard the power because the automation was not keeping up with the gusty conditions. I knew that managing the power manually would be safer for the approach.  I turned the auto throttles off with one click, which did not promptly silence the warning, just as I heard the Pilot Monitoring announce the GS intercept. As we caught up with the glideslope and the plane began to raise the nose to the three degree path, the Pilot Monitoring was still prompting me to slow down. The auto throttle cue was still chiming and the Pilot Monitoring was distracted enough by it to vocalize, 'turn it OFF already, or I'm going to do it' and began to reach over to shut it off. I responded with 'I've got it' and silenced it with my thumb. Despite my efforts to slow down and become configured on the approach in a standard manner, I allowed the plane to get too slow for the turbulent and windy conditions, because I chose to listen to the Pilot Monitoring rather than fly the aircraft according to my experience and training. In the bumpy conditions, as the airspeed decayed, the low speed cue protection system announced, 'increase speed'. I responded by pushing the power levers forward half way and noting the aircraft speed to be 137 and increasing. The Pilot Monitoring's response was to yell, 'POWER' and 'what the hell' as [he] chose to retract the air brakes. Windshear of +/- 10-15 knots continued and the 'increase speed warning' was heard again. This time, as I was pushing the power levers all the way forward, the Pilot Monitoring came from behind and pushed my hands all the way forward while yelling, 'POWER' to make sure the power levers were at maximum. After a couple seconds, and again verifying the speed was safe, I reduced the power levers to an appropriate setting for the approach. This recovery was followed by a series of berating shouts, 'come on....You can't do this to me, I thought you were better than this... Do you have this or not?' To which I responded, 'I got it'.  Once I called that the aircraft was stable, I was using the thrust vector guidance and the the flight director to keep the aircraft on track with the approach. Due to the turbulence, our speed continued to be +/- 10kts and occasionally +/- 15. I called for Flaps/Slats 2 and Pilot Monitoring extended them. I selected to fly 145 with manual speeds based on our calculated approach speed. Instead, the Pilot Monitoring then reached across and selected manual speed of 150 with no explanation. Standard Operating Procedure is for the Pilot Flying to call for the approach speed to be set, and for the Pilot Monitoring to set the requested speed. I decided to maintain the higher approach speed to ride out the bumps. I called for FS3 (Flaps/Slats 3) and then we broke out of the clouds and continued visually the rest of the way to the runway. There was a crosswind at about 45 degrees to the wet runway, gusting over 29kts as I touched down.     As we taxied across the Bravo Bridge to the FBO, the Pilot Monitoring was still upset and continued to verbalize that I shouldn't have allowed the airplane to get that slow. I apologized and continued to pay attention to the taxi route.After giving a lot of thought to the details leading up to the LSC (low speed condition) event, I can accept full responsibility for allowing the aircraft to get too slow on approach. If I had exercised more focus and superior airmanship, I would have put my full attention on flying the aircraft and I would have caught it before I ever got that slow. I fully understand that I should never have become distracted enough with the failure in communication to allow my instrument scan to slow down. Based on my experience as a 4000 hour pilot, I knew we were already high above the glideslope when I noticed how tightly we were being vectored. Because of this, I called for Flaps/Slats 1 and gear down. When the Pilot Monitoring did not act or respond to my requests as the Pilot Flying, I should either deployed the air brakes to slow for the approach or called to go-around. Looking back, with 100 hours of experience [in this] aircraft, I let my focus shift because of the Pilot Monitoring's lack of action to configure.  This inhibited my ability to stay ahead of the aircraft. Likewise, turning off the auto throttles without turning [off] the autopilot provided a false sense of security. In the future I will maintain a speed that is more conservatively above approach speed and below the FS (Flaps/Slats) and gear limitations. I will use the air brakes as required to be at the appropriate speed when the Pilot Monitoring cannot or will not configure the aircraft. Also, if the air brakes are out, I will keep my hand on the lever to remind myself to stow them when the speed is acceptable. If I deem that the auto throttles are not keeping up with the required speed, I will disengage both the autopilot and auto throttles to obtain a more real feeling of flying and controlling the aircraft. Finally, when CRM is failing in the cockpit, I will do my best to aviate, navigate, then communicate. If I had been aviating and not fixated on our poor communication and the fact that Pilot Monitoring was delaying our configuration of the aircraft until the last possible second, I would have caught the speed decreasing as the autopilot raised the nose to join the normal glideslope. Other safe and appropriate options in our situation would be to request a go around or vectors back to final.  The next time that I feel the crew does not have the aircraft configured at the final approach fix and is not ready for the approach, I will resist the temptation to fall into the hazardous attitude of 'Get-there-itis'.","","","","Falcon 900 First Officer reported weather and crew resource management issues complicated the approach into JFK.","2000, 2100","2100",TRUE,TRUE

We were in the clear and smooth air.  Our position was just west of CTB VOR (approximately 140nm east and 70nm north of the reported turbulence). I decided to put the seat belt sign on.  I called the flight attendants and told them to take their jump seats.  The purser answered and said the other two were in the aisle and she would communicate that to them.  I also made a PA that they should take their jump seats.  I am told they immediately began that process of taking the carts toward the back of the aircraft.Before the aft flight attendants could get the carts stowed and in their seats we encountered severe turbulence.  I am guessing the time frame from my communicating to the flight attendants and the turbulence was in the 3-5 minute range.  It began with a mountain wave speed increase that went up to approximately 10 knots above Vmo.  The First Officer (FO) stated he saw .83 Mach, although it may have been higher.  The severe turbulence began almost simultaneously as the airspeed increased.Our altitude went up to an observed 35,700 and down to 34,000 feet before the FO had control of the aircraft.  Bank angles went up to approximately 25 degrees in both directions as the altitude and airspeed varied.  The First Officer was flying as the autopilot disconnected due to high-speed protection mode.  I was attempting to talk to ATC but communication was difficult due to the aircraft movement.  Once I established communication we were cleared continued down to FL310.   I advised ATC of the turbulence and the inability of controlling our altitude.Once we were out of this situation I contacted the flight attendants to see if we had any injuries.  We had one flight attendant injured by the food cart landing on her leg.   No passengers reported any injuries.  I am told the carts rose up under a foot in the turbulence.  The purser was able to just get in her seat as it began.  The turbulence lasted 30 -45 seconds in my estimate (it is only an estimate).The flight attendant injured her leg. It was cut and scraped from the cart.  A nurse was on the flight. She went and checked on her and her partner.  They determined it was ok to continue destination.

For prevention of future recurrences, I believe that training can better emphasize the role ODPs play at both controlled and uncontrolled airports. In addition, I believe that training should emphasize that a 'Cleared as Filed' clearance should prompt the pilot(s) to confirm the presence/absence of an ODP. Finally, although this might be excessive, including the verbiage something like 'ODP available' when the clearance is issued would serve as a backstop to crew awareness.","","DHC-8 flight crew reported receiving an EGPWS 'Terrain' alert departing IPT.","600, 1000, 1600","600",FALSE,FALSE

I answered yes. The person helping the controller told him to have me turn on autopilot and set heading. That was a mistake. The autopilot, within 10 seconds, pitched up to maximum pitch. Pitch warning signal sounded. Red pitch light on, the annunciator turned on. The autopilot could not keep wings level. I managed to disconnect the autopilot, and turned to land towards SNS. I made the decision that I had to land. The controller determined that the closest VMC airport was ZZZ. I flew there with difficulty on maintaining level altitude. Was in IMC most of the flight. Winds were gusting and swirling until I reached 8300 MSL. At ZZZ on the descent, had to deploy 10 degrees of flaps 11 miles out to descend to pattern altitude. Landed safely with wife and dog aboard. Secured plane. Returned with mechanic who did inspection, and then we flew the plane VFR. HSI is being sent for inspection of gyro. Autopilot will be checked completely. Met with flight instructor for an hour to review the flight using flightaware.com and my notes and recollection. When the downdraft dropped and rolled the plane, I was not sure we would make it. She said only thing she would have done differently than I did was to declare an emergency. Weather was changing. Thunderstorms were forecast later in the day. No reports at the time of takeoff. My wife, after we landed, did tell me that off to our right was a dark large cloud. Yet, clouds in front of me had diffuse sun light. All that I know is that after shortly being over the ocean it was like hitting a brick wall. Had latest weather information; but, clearly was insufficient. Not sure how to improve surface and low level weather predictions on the coast.","","","","C182 pilot experienced severe turbulence at 4400 feet during climb to 7000 feet. The airspeed decreased and the aircraft lost controlled flight along with 2000 feet before control was regained. Attitude indicator and HSI were not reliable and ATC provided vectors to a VFR airport.","250, 789, 2150","250",FALSE,FALSE

The weather otherwise was severe clear with clear skies and visibilities well above 10 SM. We were prepared for and briefed the FA and the passengers for a turbulent approach and landing. Upon arrival at ROA the winds were still strong with LLWS warnings on the ATIS but aligned with runway 34. It was VERY turbulent in the last 3000 ft with significant airspeed excursions in the gusts. On about a 1.5 mile final the tower issued a windshear alert for a 15-knot loss on a one mile final. Almost simultaneously we experienced a 15-knot gain in airspeed, with, shortly thereafter, an increasing performance windshear warning. We rejected the landing and went around. We attempted another approach to the same runway but this time received a 20-knot loss warning from tower at about the same location with the same result - an increase in airspeed followed by an increasing performance windshear warning - we went around. On this go-around we evaluated the fuel required to divert to ZZZ and determined that we would divert to ZZZ if we could not get in. We asked the tower about landing in a crosswind on Runway 24 - specifically if other aircraft had used that runway and if the tower had received any windshear alerts from that area. Receiving an affirmative of the former with no windshear reports and a negative about windshear alerts from the ground-based sensing system, we attempted a third approach to Runway 24. Unfortunately this ride was rougher than the previous ones and this time we received a decreasing performance windshear alert from the onboard system. We went around a third time. Doing a quick assessment on fuel, the trending of the conditions, the effects on passenger comfort of the three previous attempts, and our own nerves, we decided to divert to ZZZ. Once on the ground we used our windshear go-around guidance of +/- 15 knots of instantaneous airspeed change to determine that we would stay in ZZZ until the reported gust factors were down to 10 knots in order to give us a good chance to get in. We monitored the conditions by calling the ROA ASOS phone number every 15 minutes. We waited about two hours for conditions to subside, then loaded up and made it in to ROA even though the ride was still very turbulent. Shortly after we opened the door, the tower issued a windshear alert for a 20-knot loss on the approach end of the runway we had just landed on. On the subsequent departure, climbing through about 4000 ft MSL we flew into a mountain wave and experienced a climb rate of up to 5800 fpm. Windshear and very turbulent conditions created an environment where the airspeed deviations were so frequent and random that cognitively we were saturated during the approach. A contributing factor was an approach controller that repeatedly wanted to immediately know our intentions even though we were in the middle of our go-arounds.  On the ground at ZZZ, I gathered the crew for a debrief which is my custom after a significant event like this. We identified a communication breakdown from the communication of trends that I identified (at a much lower workload than my flying FO) that my FO could not perceive because of his task saturation trying to fly the aircraft in the turbulent go-around.  (He didn't see a large rapid airspeed increasing trend vector on a couple occasions) The insistent controller created time pressure to complete the circuit and attempt another approach. After the second go-around, I told him we needed to fly a box pattern and evaluate our options to get him off our backs for a moment. We decided at that time if the third attempt was unsuccessful that we would divert to ZZZ. Having made that decision ahead of time reduced the subsequent divert workload somewhat. On the divert my FO initially accelerated to normal cruise speed, but I told him we needed to slow down to create some time to catch up. I don't think he was fully aware of how close ZZZ was because we were still in turbulence and he was still loaded up. When we arrived in the area, the approach controller asked us if we had the airport in sight. We did, but I told my FO I wanted to stay above 10,000 ft until we had our landing numbers, briefed the approach, and had taken a minute to ensure we were caught up with events. I instructed him to ask for a box pattern which he obtained. We had the fuel so we took our time, accomplished all tasks, dotted the I's and crossed the T's, then took a minute to take a breath and look around to ensure that everything needed to conduct the approach was done, including briefing the flight attendant, passengers, and dispatch. Once we agreed that everything was done and we were mentally caught up, I okayed the descent and approach. The rest of the divert proceeded without further incident.The main reason I submitted this ASAP was to possibly spur a conversation about dispatch decisions. I know we often depart with the intent to 'take a look' when conditions are marginal - after all, conditions often change significantly while in flight. On this day the high winds were driven by a strong low pressure center (altimeter setting of 29.42 in FWA the previous day) located in the eastern Ohio valley and were widespread over the Appalachians and forecast to remain so during the day. It occurred to me while we were on the ground at ZZZ that the forecast gust factors were well above our windshear go around criteria of an instantaneous airspeed change of 15 knots and plus/minus 500 fpm.  In a situation like this, in mountainous terrain where we KNOW the conditions significantly exceed our windshear go-around guidance and are not likely to change, should this modify our usual approach to 'take a look' or should we treat conditions like this the same as an extensive thunderstorm complex hovering over the destination. Ergo - should our policy be that we wait for improved conditions before launching? Should we use forecast and reported gust factors of above 15 knots as a no-go decision criteria for launching the flight?","","","","During multiple visual approaches to ROA, flight crew received windshear alerts from both ground-based sensors via ATC and on-board detection equipment. The crew diverted after receiving the same result on the third approach. The Captain suggested that ATC delay questioning crews about their intentions immediately after a go-around, especially in turbulent/windshear conditions.","3000, 4000, 5800, 10000","3000",FALSE,FALSE

We were pretty shaken up during the arrival since neither the captain or myself had experienced this type of turbulence before. We thought we had done all required actions until this morning we were debriefing our performance and in revisiting flight manual part one under required reports we realized we had kept dispatch out of the loop. A report to dispatch was required after landing when encountering severe turbulence. In retrospect we tend to forget about dispatch once the flight lands and we leave the aircraft.  Hence mentally we remove our attachment to them. Inflight we depend on the great support that they provide and we make the required position/ride reports as necessary to keep them abreast of our progress.

Upon arriving for XA04 show time, severe weather had halted all flights and we were delayed indefinitely. When our plane arrived at XE30, I spoke with our dispatcher about my concerns for dispatching into this system. She said we should be able to penetrate the storm line around Monroe, go east of the WX, and fly north and land slightly ahead of the storms with some moderate turbulence, now slicing through LA-AR-MO to the Great Lakes. Our gate fuel was 5600 lbs with no alternate, moderate to severe turbulence reported on www.adds.aviationweather.gov, and the weather scheduled to arrive at ZZZ1 at the same time as we were. I requested severe weather alternates (escape routes) be added and more fuel be uploaded. She agreed to bring our ramp fuel to 6600 lbs and added ZZZ2 and ZZZ as 'unofficial alternates'; however, I told her I wanted to stay west of the line and let it pass ZZZ1. I also delayed the flight until the flight crew was comfortable that the weather was going to be manageable. Our XB04 scheduled flight departed at XF47, and we elected to fly IAH-ZZZ2-TXK-ZZZ1 west of the line of storms, but encountered continuous light with occasional moderate chop reported at all altitudes. Upon completing the Cruise Checklist, I observed that we would land with 2500 lbs at ZZZ1. The dispatcher notified us twice on free text ACARS that we needed to turn east toward Monroe and navigate through the weather to the east of the line. We declined and stayed on the west side, and she felt the weather would be worse penetrating further north. I advised ATC that we would evaluate the storm situation over ZZZ2 and make a 'go-no go' decision into ZZZ1 there. Center advised us that the weather had diminished and that there was a gap we could get through. As we got closer to ZZZ1, our landing fuel had decreased to 2300 lbs, and I mentioned to the F/O (First Officer) that diverting could be a problem now. We were also reporting light rime icing and moderate turbulence on the final descent. Upon contacting Approach, I declared 'Min Fuel', even though we would be landing with 2300 lbs just as a precaution. The ATIS was calling for winds 160@26g39, so we set up for a flaps 22 landing on Runway 18R. We broke out in the clear on final approach, but got a red (increasing) windshear warning from GPWS on short final. We executed a missed approach and climbed out of the shear, evaluated our fuel, and elected one more approach. Once again, on short final, we received a red windshear warning and went missed approach. After evaluating the situation, I elected to declare for low fuel (we were at 2100 lbs on the EICAS) and had to decide between ZZZ2 or ZZZ. ZZZ2 was 140 nm away but with severe storms and windshear while ZZZ was 160 nm away but smooth ride and clear. The fuel planning showed we would land at ZZZ with 1100 lbs, and we elected to also select Muscle Shoals and Decatur as emergency landing airports in case we experienced an engine flame out. I briefed the flight attendant of the emergency, informed the passengers as well as dispatch of the emergency, and diverted to ZZZ. We executed a descent, approach, and visual approach to ZZZ, landed with 1200 lbs of fuel, taxied to the gate followed by emergency vehicles, and parked uneventfully.  Upon completing the parking checklist, the station personnel asked if we were ready to depart for ZZZ1 and fly from there to Houston, scheduled to land at our duty day maximum thirteen hours. I informed them my crew and I were a bit uptight and tired and to give us at least 30 minutes to decide what to do. The line of severe weather was on top of ZZZ1 at this time. Thirty minutes later, fatigued and still deeply concerned over the situation which has just occurred, we elected not to fly anymore. I advised scheduling and spoke with the Chief Pilot on Call about the situation. The CP (Chief Pilot) called again and asked where we were. I told her the crew was still on the plane, the passengers inside, and us still waiting for Crew Scheduling to get us a hotel. She expressed great concern over these events and prompted Ops to get us to a hotel. Right away, the Hub Coordinator called and apologized for scheduling us ZZZ-ZZZ1-KIAH, as he did not realize we had had a low fuel emergency. The combination of severe storms, no alternates originally, over four hour delays, turbulence/windshear, and a company cost saving program which puts our minimum fuel dangerously low in critical situation could prove to be catastrophic in the future, I erred greatly in not getting the fuel brought up even higher than 6600 lbs to 8000 lbs for example- and not delaying the flight ever further until the storms were assured of passing east of ZZZ1. I further misjudged the situation by attempting a second approach attempt into ZZZ1 as opposed to diverting. Finally, ZZZ2 was closer and although thunderstorms windshear and hail were a threat, may have been more suitable fuel wise. Perhaps we could have diverted upon reaching ZZZ2 VOR. Perhaps, since many flights were cancelled out of KIAH, we should have never been dispatched and cancelled the flight, as well. I am very concerned that our fuel cost program is putting flight crews in difficult situations where landing on emergency fuel, or worse yet, landing with flamed out engines may become a reality. Ultimately, it is my responsibility, and I failed to fulfill those responsibilities tonight.","","","","EMB145 Captain reported a difficult flight due to turbulence and thunderstorms. Two missed approaches occurred at the destination airport due to windshear warnings on short final. The crew then diverted to an alternate, landing with 1200 pounds of fuel, and elected not to continue their duty day.","6600, 8000","6600",FALSE,FALSE

While on downwind on the arrival we were assigned 2 speed restrictions. The last one was for 190 knots. We were turned onto base. We were then turned to intercept the localizer. We maintained 190 knots until given our approach clearance which did not include a speed restriction. According to JO 7110.65W Section 7 Speed Adjustment 5-7-1c which states, 'At the time approach clearance is issued, previously issued speed adjustments must be restated if required.' AIM 4-4-12 g says,' Approach clearances supersede any prior speed adjustment assignments, and pilots are expected to make their own speed adjustments as necessary to complete the approach. However, under certain circumstances, it may be necessary for ATC to issue further speed adjustments after approach clearance is issued to maintain separation between successive arrivals. Under such circumstances, previously issued speed adjustments will be restated if that speed is to be maintained or additional speed adjustments are requested. Speed adjustments should not be assigned inside the final approach fix on final or a point 5 miles from the runway, whichever is closer to the runway.'Since we were not assigned a speed restriction with the approach clearance, we began to slow as we felt was appropriate and safe for the conditions. The Monitor controller asked us a few miles from the final approach fix 'what is your speed?' We stated that it was 145 (approximately) and slowing. He then said, 'We can't have you going that slow there. You have to keep your speed up.' The first officer, with my direction, told him we were not assigned a speed restriction with our approach clearance. There was a pause and then the controller came back and said, 'I asked the other guy and he said he assigned you 190.' We said that we were not assigned speed on approach clearance and did not read it back with a speed restriction. My concern here is that the controllers in Atlanta think that the speed restriction they give us on downwind assumes that we will maintain that speed until the final approach fix. If we missed the controller, who gave us the clearance for an approach speed restriction, stating a speed restriction, we would hope he would restate the speed restriction. We then sped back up until the final approach fix. Considering the weather conditions and shooting a PRM approach with close in traffic, it would seem that keeping speed up is counterintuitive to safety.I believe this is non-compliance by the Air traffic controller in the Atlanta ATC. The Atlanta controller need to be aware of the fact that the speed restriction needs to be restated with the approach clearance.","","When on the RNAV arrival we were given speed of 190 knots. On base we were given a turn to intercept final and I thought we were told to maintain 5000 feet until established on the ILS course and that is what I responded with in the radio transmission back to approach. We intercepted final and were closely monitoring abeam traffic on the South runways approach. We selected FMS speed and the aircraft slowed to FMS target speed profile. Slowing through approximately 145 knots a different tower controller voice contacted us (I assumed on the monitor frequency) and asked our indicated airspeed. I told him we were at 141 knots and slowing to 136 knots final approach speed. He came back with 'Well we can't have you at that speed.' and told us to speed back up. I can't remember if he gave us a new speed or not. He then asked why we had slowed so early from 190 knots and I told him we were not given that restriction to which he responded that we were. I had not heard that and did not respond to approach with a speed restriction on the dogleg turn readback. The captain sped up to about 160 knots before we reached the Final Approach Fix. I was somewhat surprised that during PRM approaches through weather on final they expected any aircraft to fly 190 knots to the Final Approach Fix. Miscommunication with ATC. Possible assumption of compliance with routine procedures at an airport we are unfamiliar with. Clear and concise from ATC in directing the restriction and responding if the readback is not IAW his/her instruction. ATC needs to treat PRM approaches with more concern and realize these are increased risk maneuvers.","","Flight crew reported a concern when the Controller asked them why they slowed down. The reporters noted the regulation that ATC speed assignments must be restated with an approach clearance.","5000","5000",FALSE,FALSE

After going south of the airport then on an extended downwind, we were finally given a heading to intercept the LOC. After we began to capture the LOC the controllers were giving us some speed tolerances and at around 25+ miles our plane began a severe right turn breaking off the LOC. At about the same time it became obvious the approach controller asked where we were going. I pulled the heading knob and began a left turn back. Once established on a heading I reengaged the LOC, at the same time the controller came on and told us to maintain 160 kts and the LOC broke off again, this time towards the left. Again I switched to heading mode and with the winds at altitude being out of the southwest at around 45 knots it took a great deal to get back on course. A final attempt was made to engage the approach again but again this time it started a hard right turn, I disengaged the auto pilot and began flying the plane and using raw data to regain the LOC and GS. I believe somewhere outside of [the FAF] we were completely established and unfortunately had a scud layer at about 1000 ft to go through before making visual contact with the runway. The raw data was working but the auto pilot was not responding correctly, and unfortunately due to the issues at hand we didn't get the opportunity to try the other AP.Because of the stress of the weather for the night and due to a long flight, combined with the constant vectoring and speed changes, I cannot completely say it was not an operator issue. I do know that any time the AP was engaged for the approach it vectored off and that when I hand flew it with the flight director it worked fine. Again I would like to have had the opportunity to try the other AP, I truly believe it was a mechanical malfunction. I'm not really sure how this could have been prevented beforehand but it certainly gets the attention in my book to kick off the auto pilot more often and just fly the plane.","","","","MD-11 First Officer reported the autopilot failed to track the localizer on approach.","1000","1000",FALSE,FALSE

Duration was approximately 5 mins. It was the worst turbulence I have encountered in my 30 plus years of flying. Location was close to the shoreline, as our routing on departure from ZZZ had us flying north for a bit, before being turned east, to cross the water. There had been no other aircraft on our frequencies mentioning severe turbulence. There was no convective activity in the area, although very high winds on the ground and aloft, associated with a cold front. The seat belt sign was turned on, passengers were all seated. The flight attendants in the back had just gotten their carts out to begin their service. Severe turbulence began without warning. The FB had just gone back to business class to begin his break. Both CA and FO had our hands full to maintain aircraft control. FO was pilot flying. We disconnected Auto Pilot and Auto Throttles, and attempted to climb out of the turbulence. It took us longer than expected, due to previously mentioned lack of complete aircraft control. Airspeed loss was approximately 60 knots, from 310 down to 250 before airspeed decay was arrested and a climb to smooth air was accomplished. Once we leveled at 310 and were out of the turbulence and building airspeed, I took over ATC communications and the CA handled the cabin. The Captain was informed of the cabin injuries and immediately [advised ATC] and directed a return to ZZZ. The FB remained in the cabin to help with the injured crew members. One woman had a head wound and the other, who was more seriously injured, had a flying full food service cart land on her. As soon as injured were as stable as possible, FB returned to cockpit to aid in our emergency return. We were all concerned that we might descend thru the turbulence area, so we flew south for 30 miles or so, before turning back west towards ZZZ. We were able to miss the turbulence on descent. We were going to be overweight by about 20,000 lbs, so we accomplished the Over Weight Landing checklist. We radioed ops and had ambulances waiting for us at gate. We asked for, and received, clearance to straight in ILS to Runway XXR. Weather was clear and wind was well within limits. Uneventful approach and landing on the long runway, with minimal brake usage, due to overweight condition. ZZZ ATC was outstanding through the entire event, enroute, approach and tower and ground at ZZZ.Arrived at gate, passengers remained seated to allow EMTs to get to rear of aircraft. Injured crew safely removed and passengers allowed to deplane. Many frightened, scared passengers. Cabin crew was injured, very emotionally upset, but still performed their duties admirably. The three of us pilots were very keyed-up and over-loaded on adrenaline after what we had been through, and after a brief, closed door conference, the three of us decided that we were not mentally or physically fit for duty to fly an 8 hour flight across the Atlantic into forecast heavy winds over in England, with possible missed approach and/or diversion. The Captain handled the communication with crew tracking and the chief pilot. We then went down to operations and spent the next 30-45 minutes winding down and reviewing our flight. The longer we talked the more convinced I was that we were making a wise decision in not continuing that evening.","","We were about 30 minutes into our flight and I had just sat down in the cabin to start my break when we encountered severe turbulence. It lasted anywhere from 5-10 minutes. After the worst of it had passed I noticed our purser rushing through the cabin to the aft part of the aircraft. I curiously followed her and found [three] FA's injured in the back galley with a galley cart laying on its side and its content spilling out. I then returned to the flight deck to assist in coordinating our emergency arrival with ramp, dispatch and maintenance. After an uneventful landing, we were expedited to the gate. Next came firemen, paramedics, ambulances and police officers along with crying passengers and injured and upset FAs. At this point there was some discussion about getting a 767 and new FAs available to continue flight but nobody had a time frame set. The three of us then decided, per our Human Factors guidance, to discuss our ability to perform our duties safely going forward after an adrenaline producing event like the one we had just incurred and came to the conclusion that we were probably more affected than we cared to admit at that point. Looking at the weather both at ZZZ and the potential of similar weather at the destination according to the forecast, along with not knowing when an aircraft and crew would be ready, we decided after another 20-30 min. discussion that it wouldn't be in the best interest of safety for us to continue with [the] flight. We had all been under a great deal of stress and were all starting to feel a little overwhelmed. At that point, we returned to operations and spent the next 45 minutes discussing what had happened and decompressing. We didn't get any reports of severe turbulence and while we had heard reports of turbulence, none of them reached the point we experienced. Perhaps we could have kept the FAs seated a little longer but as mentioned there were no prior indications of turbulence of even close to this magnitude.","","B757 flight crew reported encountering severe turbulence on climb out that resulted in injuries to several flight attendants.","250, 310, 30000","310",FALSE,FALSE

Upon arrival at the aircraft, I called the Dispatcher regarding our fuel load and the strong possibility of the ATL closing after I pushed from the gate. We had ZZZ2 as an alternate due to the forecast of wind shear in ZZZ at 2000 feet of 40 knots (WS020/15040KT) which was predicted for a period of 11 hours. [The Dispatcher] assured me we could delete the alternate in order to reduce the [minimum fuel] if I needed it during taxi or for an airport closure. We began to board the aircraft soon after I arrived and I began to receive tornado warnings with the line of weather and track of rotation coming directly towards ATL Airport. After concurrence with the Dispatcher and Ops, I decided to deplane the aircraft due to the Tornado Warning for KATL. After deplaning the passengers, I went downstairs and looked at the radar further. The line of strong thunderstorms which was currently hitting KATL was moving in a more northerly track as opposed to an easterly track. With my departure and flight path, I was to remain within the convective activity during the entire flight with not much assurance of a safe landing in ZZZ based on the storm track and other information available. I contacted [the Dispatcher] again and brought this to his attention. [He] asked me if it would be 'good enough' if he brought up the past weather for ZZZ1 as well as the current METAR for ZZZ, and told me the 'visibility in [there] went from 4SM down to 2 1/2 SM, down to 1 1/2SM and then came back up. The ceiling was only down to 4000 so you'll be fine'. He also told me 'this is what you (myself) get paid to do', alleging it was my duty to transport the passengers regardless of the conditions based on my pay scale. As the conversation continued, I told him I was truly concerned for the first time in 15 years for the safety of this flight since I was not ever 'flying away from the weather' and was to be in it the entire time. He again made the comment of it's what I'm 'paid to do'. I asked him who made the ultimate decision on the cancellation of this flight since a [another] flight just cancelled and it will have a similar issue in direction of flight. He responded he 'can't help the [other] flight' but he makes the ultimate decision and relays it to the Sector Manager. I told him I wasn't comfortable with operating the flight and he told me he saw 'no reason whatsoever' to consider the cancellation of this flight since the METAR and TAF are legal. He also made the comment of 'since you (myself) seem to be taking control over this from me, what do you suggest?' I finally tired of his snide, unprofessional comments, told him I was the one who had to safely transport passengers through the weather, and told him I was calling the Chief Pilot on call. I spoke with [the Chief Pilot] and briefed him on the situation. [He] fully agreed with me and suggested I wait an additional 30 min to an hour to see what the line of weather would do. My primary concern was flying within the line the entire time and the convection expected and [the Chief Pilot] agreed. I called [the Dispatcher] back and told him of [the Chief Pilot's] concurrence with my views and my decision to wait an additional 30 minutes. During this time, Ops decided to auto-board my aircraft again even though I asked the Gate Agent to wait. Seeing it as a huge inconvenience to deplane the passengers a second time, I decided to keep them on the aircraft as I watched the radar. I kept the passengers informed the entire time and during each step. Approximately [30 minutes later], Ops called me on the radio and told me the flight had cancelled. I contacted [the Dispatcher] yet again (no indication from him it was cancelled), and he told me he had 'brought my concerns to the Duty Manager and the Duty Manager said we needed a weather cancellation anyways so we decided to cancel your flight'.[The Dispatcher's] lack of professionalism and concern for the overall weather situation, direction of flight, and inflight conditions are alarming, especially when the concerns of the PIC are brought to his attention and he makes snide comments on them. I should not have to tolerate at any time a Dispatcher telling me 'it's what you're paid to do' or other snide comments. The Dispatcher showed no concern whatsoever in the overall safe operation of the flight. The Dispatcher was adamant the flight was 'safe to operate' based solely on TAF and METAR information available, primarily on the actual and forecast visibility and cloud coverage at the destination airport. There was no consideration or concern for inflight weather. The direction of the flight between ATL and ZZZ was north/northeast, which was the exact track of the storm system which produced tornadoes south of ATL upon completion of boarding in ATL the first time. Only after tiring of the Dispatcher's snide remarks of its 'what you're (myself) paid to do', I called the CP on call. [He] fully concurred with my decisions based on my experience with this storm system over the last 2 days as well as based on current weather conditions and radar. This valuable information was provided to the Dispatcher, who blatantly ignored it.","","","","The pilot of a Regional Jet reported being concerned about the weather along the planned route of flight.

The autopilot was disconnected and I called for and initiated a go-around, taking control of aircraft. As the go-around commenced, ATC advised of a low altitude alert. The go-around was executed and completed as ATC issued a clearance to climb to 3,000 feet and vectors to the southwest.  ATC then asked if we wanted to try the ILS V Runway 17 due to the more favorable winds for that runway and the possible glideslope issue on 9R. We accepted vectors for the ILS V Runway 17 and flew a standard approach to a landing, with all aircraft autoflight systems operating normally.

The weather in LGA was marginal all day with low ceilings, rain and gusty winds. The two prior flights to ours had cancelled and the two flights after us cancelled as well. Our aircraft arrived late and we spent close to an hour in the awaiting our EDCT. We held for close 40 minutes just 5 minutes shy of diverting to AVP or JFK. We were vectored for ILS 13 to LGA and were informed of PIREPs reporting speed gains and losses of up to 15 knots on final. With the speed fluctuations, I instructed the FO (pilot monitoring) to watch my speed. At 1000 feet MSL we experienced the reported speed gains and losses of 15kts a couple times. We were in IMC, it was raining heavily and the wipers were on high - cockpit noise was high. I kept the AP and AT's on as I transitioned from 'inside the cockpit' to 'outside - flying visually' as the FO called the runway -'in sight!' [At] 600-700 feet [AGL] I got visual of the runway. Prior to the '500 foot call out' we got the wind shear warning. The warning lasted just a few seconds and my speed fluctuated only 10-12kts. By the time I realized what had happened the warning went away, we were still on glide path, localizer and the speed was under control. I continued the approach and landed safely. We discussed what had happened after the flight and both agreed that I should have initiated the wind shear recovery procedure. The FO said he prompted me to initiate the recovery procedure but I didn't hear it at the time. I realized what had happened too late and it was over so quick. I never actually heard the 3 wind shear audible warnings. This was my first wind shear warning on landing, outside the simulator.Be more proactive and vigilant when it comes to wind shear events. Brief recovery procedures prior to takeoff and landing, when wind shear warnings/PIREPs exist.","","We experienced gains and losses of 5 to 10 knots for the first portion of the approach. The Captain was overriding the autothrottles the entire time, but he was able to keep the airspeed fluctuations to a minimum. We experienced at least one loss of about 15 knots at about 1,000 feet. When we switched to the tower frequency, we were told that the preceding aircraft reported a loss of 15 knots at 500 feet. When we were about 500 feet, we experienced a momentary loss of about 12 knots. The Captain quickly brought the power up, and the airspeed immediately recovered. Moments later, and after the speed recovered, we received a windshear warning. The warning surprised both of us because it occurred after the event. Regardless, I said, 'firewall thrust, go around,' but he did not go around. At this time, I remember looking at the instrument panel, and the aircraft was on speed, established, and on glide path; it was as if nothing happened. The Captain continued the approach, and we landed without incident. After we got on the ground, we discussed what happened. We both agreed that we should have gone around, despite the fact that the airspeed recovered so quickly. The Captain told me that he thought it was a windshear caution and he should have listened to me; I told him that I needed to speak up.In training, the difference between a windshear caution and warning should be emphasized and practiced more than once during each recurrent sim session. In addition, it should be stressed that whenever any flight crewmember calls a go around, it should be immediately executed without hesitation.","","ERJ-170 flight crew reported receiving a wind shear warning on approach to LGA but nevertheless continued to landing.","500, 700, 1000","500",FALSE,FALSE

We flew down from our destination earlier and were cognizant of the convective activity around the area. We decided to hold west of the field and analyze the movement of the weather which was between us and the runway extending north to south for twenty miles. Other aircraft followed us into the hold.We saw a break in the line to the south of the field and flew until we could turn to the final approach fix and executed the RNAV approach. We picked up the field at 1,400 MSL and landed without incident. The weather worsened while at the gate with heavy rain and strong winds. I spoke with our Dispatcher on a plan for departure. He suggested FL280 for a better ride. We previously flew down at FL 390 and it was continuous light with some moderate turbulence.At taxi out, we decided to hold short of the departure runway and wait for the storms to move through. After considerable improvement in the weather we taxied on to the runway and made a radar sweep. The departure corridor looked excellent. We departed and climbed to FL 280. We requested a westerly deviation and were eight miles from our original track. We were well clear of any cells. I turned back on course after analyzing the radar. Out of nowhere we hit an area of severe turbulence which lasted for 3-5 seconds.The autopilot remained engaged and altitude varied plus or minus 200 feet. I immediately made a PA announcement for the Flight Attendants (FAs) to take their seats. I was informed by our Purser that she was thrown to the floor and the B FA was on the aft galley floor unable to get up. I told her to see if a Doctor was on board to help. Fortunately there was. I then reassured our customers that this was an isolated occurrence and to remain seated for the remainder of the flight.We conducted an HF phone patch with Dispatch to discuss the event that transpired. After receiving the B FAs vitals and condition, it was decided to continue to the destination. The physician had our FA stabilized in the last row. The flight continued and landed where medical personnel met our aircraft and transported our B FA to the hospital. The A FA had a lot of back pain but stayed on the trip. Our C FA also had back pain and got off the trip the following day. During deplaning a passenger told me she injured her thumb and ear during the turbulence and wanted medical evaluation. However, one of our crew members talked to her after we left the sterile period and she showed her the black and blue thumb before the incident happened. Also, she claimed to have hurt her left ear on the cabin sidewall but was seated in seat 14F. It would have been her right ear.Turbulence is a serious issue and this incident is a call to be even more cautious and vigilant in all phases of flight.","","[Report Narrative Contained No Additional Information.]","","An Aircraft encountered severe turbulence in the vicinity of convective weather activity.

On our second attempt we got a wind shear alert and went around again, so this time I was ready for what I anticipated to be a difficult approach and landing.At approximately 200 feet AGL I encountered a gust from the left (winds were 240 at 13 gusting to 21 KTS). I sharply countered the gust using left stick, however I overcorrected and the plane rolled approximately 10 [degrees] to the left. I countered that roll with right stick, but also over corrected so the plane entered a similar bank angle to the right. I corrected for that with left stick and at that point realized I was encountering a pilot induced oscillation so I then centered the stick to get out of the oscillation. During the oscillation the spoilers had extended apparently causing us to get a bit low on profile.The Captain said something like 'you're getting low.' At that point I noticed one white light and three red lights on the PAPI so I decreased my sink and said 'correcting.' The landing was fine and uneventful. After blocking-in I talked with the Captain about the approach and my oscillation. He suggested that I hand fly the airplane more during gusty weather and disconnect the autopilot earlier during the approach (I disconnected it at minimums.) I plan on following this advice to help get a better feel for the winds effects on the plane.I think that because of my previous experience on that runway with gusty winds I was 'over-primed' to make corrections that in this case were too much.","","","","A320 First Officer landing during gusty crosswind conditions encountered pilot induced oscillations.

We had flown earlier that day and knew there was some turbulence in the area.  Looking at the weather packet, we only noted an area of Moderate along our route from FL340 to FL390.  The Captain asked the Flight Attendants to remain seated until he called them enroute.  During the climb out, we did experience some Light Turbulence, and asked ATC about the rides.  They said that FL 390 and above had been reported as 'good ride.'We leveled off at FL390 and did have a 'good ride' (only small areas of light chop.) The Captain told the Flight Attendants they could start their service.  The flight continued to be mostly smooth so the Captain turned the seatbelt sign off.  From that point on, we did not received any adverse ride reports.  We had the radar on for most of the flight and were showing no weather ahead.  We were given an initial decent to FL350 with a crossing restriction of 11,000 feet at KAYLA.  The Captain turned the seatbelt sign ON for the descent.  We never leveled off at FL350 because we were already high for a crossing restriction. We were asked to keep the speed up.  With the huge tailwind, I transitioned 310 knots to maintain the flight path. The descent was not turbulent and we had not heard any other aircraft reporting adverse rides.  At approximately FL210, we encountered Moderate Turbulence and the airspeed quickly jumped up 20 knots and showing trend into Vmo.  I pulled back on the yolk to stop the descent; the autothrottles were already at idle.  The Captain asked Flight Attendants to take their seats over the PA.  The airspeed responded just under 340 knots.  It seemed we were in the clear and it had been small sheer zone.  We then encountered Severe Turbulence at approximately FL 200. The airspeed instantly increased from around 310 to 340-350. I immediately pulled back on yolk to slow plane down and thrust lever were still at idle.  The airspeed was slow to respond.  I eventually got it slowed to 280 and we continued descent. The plane was continuously jolted and banked abruptly.  The whole encounter lasted about three to four minutes. At approximately FL 180 we were clear of the severe turbulence.  The Flight Attendant called the Captain and told him the aft Flight Attendant injured her ankle trying to get to her seat.  The Captain reported the Severe Turbulence to ATC and Dispatch. We were given relief on the crossing restriction. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The paramedics met us at gate and attended to the injured Flight Attendant. There were no other injuries report to us.","","Enroute with the Flight Attendants seated until approximately 15 minutes into the cruise flight due to turbulence. Approximately 30 minutes later, we were given a descent. Prior to the Top of Descent, I turned the seatbelt sign on as it had previously been off due to smooth rides. The descent was smooth until 21,000 feet where we encountered Moderate Turbulence. I immediately made a PA and told the Flight Attendants to take their seats. As we passed 20,000 feet we encountered Severe Turbulence with large fluctuations in airspeed and attitude. The Severe Turbulence lasted approximately two to three minutes and did not stop until we left 18,000 feet. Shortly after, the A Flight Attendant informed us that Flight Attendant had been hurt and would require medical assistance upon our arrival at the gate. I informed Operations and they complied with our request. We had no indications from Air Traffic Control or our weather packet that would indicate such ride conditions existed. Furthermore, we had no indication visually or on our weather radar of Severe Turbulence. I reported our encounter to Air Traffic Control as well as our Dispatcher through ACARS for any and all aircraft in the area. We landed without further incident and the injured Flight Attendant was removed by medical personnel.

I discussed briefly with the First Officer (FO) the possibility of landing with flaps 20 due to my concern with controlling the aircraft attitude in view of the 40 gusting to 60 knots of wind, even thought it was only 30 degrees from runway heading.  After discussing the merits of a flaps 20 landing, we added 20 knots to the flaps 20 ref speed (125 knots for our weight) and selected 145 as our reference.  I also instructed the FO to select the flap override switch to 'override' to eliminate the nuisance flap/terrain call.  Other than the gusting winds and being very difficult to control, the remaining portion of the approach to touchdown was, all things considered, uneventful and uncomfortable.  It wasn't until I was in the hotel room that I decided to look at the 757 AOM to determine if my 'procedures' were in fact compatible with the 757, as they were with other aircraft I've flown.  I cannot find any provision in the AOM that permits or prohibits landing with flaps 20 in extremely strong and gusty winds.  I apparently, and inadvertently, landed in a flap configuration contrary to 757 AOM procedures.  Next time in this situation (for which I don't recall ever training to, wind 40G60) I will use the full 30 degree flap setting, or if it becomes uncontrollable, I will divert.","","","","A B757-200 Captain made the decision to land Flaps 20 with reported winds of 190/40G60. Later, he realized the Aircraft Operating Manual permitted Flaps 20 landings only in specific conditions and winds were apparently not included.","29000","29000",FALSE,FALSE

Dispatch provided information available at the time.  Normally, I am able to get real-time graphic updates via aircraft WiFi, WSI updates on our iPad EFBs, and or ACARS Dispatch notes.  Today, as is becoming the norm, WiFi was inop on this aircraft.  Dispatch provided at least 5 turbulence advisories as we proceeded along [our] route of flight.  These advisories are generated by WSI and are in a format that includes 'boxes' delineated by points defined by Lat/Long and or by Fix/bearing/Dist.  This particular flight I received three moderate turbulence advisories issued almost simultaneously that included, between the three,  THIRTY-THREE fixes.  One advisory [used] 18 fixes to define the advisory area.  The fixes included a mix of Lat/Long and P/B/dist fixes.  It took an inordinant amount of time, and was a major distracting factor, to digest, plot, and react to the textual information provided by WSI.  The first issue was the sheer number of fixes.  I believe a useable 'Box' can be defined with 4-6 points.  WSI's attempt at accuracy is not a positive factor in the ultimate safety of the operation, because it requires much time to digest and plot, electronically on the map display, or on the paper plotting chart.  I actually was exiting an area of the turbulence advisory, before I realized it applied to my route of flight.  Another major issue with the useability of the fixes is that it is simply not possible to electronically depict more than two Fix/Bearing/Dist. points on the Map Display electronically.  I queried Our dispatcher and he expressed some mutual frustration in the format of the WSI advisories.  He even indicated that changes were requested from the dispatch end of the information flow - with no result.  This is my attempt to express 'End-User' frustration with the quality of these advisories.  I believe turbulence is one of the FAAs and the company's 'Hot Items'.

I was relief for the flight but occupying the FO seat as PM. CA was in the left seat as PF. We were skirting an area of strong convective activity, deviating well north of our filed routing. Visibility was generally good, with patchy areas of blow-off from TRW. Flight attendants were advised 'It will probably get bumpy in 15 minutes' as we approached the area of TRW. Aircraft was autopilot ON, LNAV/VNAV engaged, seatbelt sign ON. We encountered a region of strong/severe turbulence that badly injured one flight attendant, with several others bruised and shaken. Passengers not in their seats with belts fastened were jostled to varying degrees. We expedited our arrival, informing dispatch of the incident, and requesting operations to have paramedics standing by. None of the passengers wanted to be examined by paramedics; all deplaned. The injured flight attendant was taken to a local hospital; she returned with us the next day. Turbulence encounter entered into AC log book.Our approach/deviation around the area of TRW activity was standard. The major deviation we took to the North appeared safe. Obviously, it wasn't.

Aircraft was hit with unexpected severe turbulence approximately 25 minutes before landing, during initial descent. FA-B was injured as a result of the turbulence by being thrown out of her jumpseat, at which time her back was slammed into the seat on her way down incurring a road rash like burn and bruising (especially apparent on her left side) and also subsequently hit the right side of her head. FA-B is unsure as to what or when her head it. FA-B had a temporary loss of consciousness. Approximately 30 minutes before arrival, the CA announced over the PA to the PAX that the plane had just begun it's descent. During announcement, the CA mentioned 'there may be slight bumpiness'. The CA did not state, 'flight attendants prepare cabin' so FA-A contacted the flight deck and spoke to FO to inquire if that announcement was her 'prepare cabin announcement' (since that is often when it is given). FO stated it wasn't quite that time yet, however he stated we could go ahead and make that announcement early and start cleaning up, as there was a possibility of upcoming turbulence. FA-A made the initial descent announcement and followed up by conveying the information to FA-B. Both flight attendants began clean up/compliance/securing the cabin/galley. FA-B gave FA-A a thumbs up from the back of the cabin indicating all was secure in the main cabin as well as all compliance necessary for landing. FA-A contacted FA-B via phone, and stated that even though we still had one more announcement and final walk through to do after sterile, that FA-B should go ahead and be seated as a precautionary measure since she had completed her compliance (her galley was secure, all open containers emptied/restocked, no one in the restroom and the main cabin was also compliant). It was agreed upon that after sterile, if there was no unsafe turbulence we could walk the cabin one last time, if necessary. At that time the turbulence was light and sporadic. Additionally, no unsafe turbulence was anticipated, we were all just working to make for an easier and safer descent by cleaning up and getting seated early. FA-B then attempted to get into her jump seat. During FA-B''s attempt to buckle her seat belt (both arms were in the straps already) the plane began to experience severe turbulence. The jerking of the plane locked the straps preventing FA-B from snapping the seatbelt closed. Again, FA-B attempted to snap the seat belt together but the turbulence again locked the straps preventing her from locking the seat belt. Upon her third attempt to lock the seat belt a jolt of turbulence launched FA-B upward and out of her seat (including her arms being pulled out of the straps). It is believed (no witness) that as FA-B was launched upward the jump seat bottom closed partially upward so that as her body came down her back was thrown violently into the metal bar of the seat bottom. The next thing FA-B recalls is passengers in the back rows of the plane asking her if she was okay. She was initially disoriented at this point, had definitely had the wind knocked out of her and was concerned if she would even be able to walk as it felt like she may have broken her back or something severe like that due to the extreme pain. The passengers assisted FA-B to an actual cabin seat as she crawled slowly toward them and they reached out their hands to help pull her forward. She eventually was able to get into a seat (row 21 she believes) with their assistance. A PAX actually bucked FA-B as she was that weak and in that much pain. All of this occurred before the plane entered sterile.Note: FA-A was unaware of what had happened to FA-B until after the doors were disarmed because while FA-B was attempting to get into her jump seat and the severe turbulence began, FA-A was getting her paperwork with the arrival announcement, as well as the report which stated the arrival gate and baggage claim info. When theturbulence hit, FA-A still had a cabinet open where the papers were and immediately had to deal with keeping herself safe as she was too far from her jump seat to even try to sit down. FA-A did at one point see FA-B appear to be sitting on the floor in the last two rows of the cabin (in the aisle) when there was a momentary slowing of the turbulence (FA-A was attempting to get an assessment of the cabin as well as an assessment of 'how can I get to my jump seat [or to] safety' especially since there really was nothing on the floor for FA-A to hold onto if she tried to sit down) FA-A (me) believed that FA-B was following protocol for severe turbulence while in cabin, immediately sit and if necessary have PAX assist by holding on to you. By the time FA-A was able to get down and crawl safely to her jump seat FA-B was no longer on the main cabin aisle floor. FA-A assumed FA-B was in her jump seat as well. After the doors were both disarmed and crosschecked FA-B called FA-A and confirmed disarming/crosschecking. As PAX began to deplane, FA-B called and told FA-A that she was hurt but with no specific details. FA-A immediately notified the CA. The CA inquired to the severity and inquired if paramedics would be needed, and FA-A stated it was unknown. The CA immediately made his way through the remaining PAX to get to FA-B and assess the situation. Ultimately, the paramedics were called to assess FA-B and then it was decided FA-B needed to be taken to the hospital for further evaluation. FA-A accompanied FA-B to the hospital and remained with FA-B until all tests were completed and FA-B was released from the hospital. Also, please note that I FA-A was tossed around like a ragdoll (or as FA-B said I looked like 'a monkey swinging in the air'). FA-A did hit head several times on the ceiling as she was lifted and completely airborne, but did not incur any pain.Unfortunately due to the nature of the unexpected severe turbulence I believe it was handled as best as possible. The FO did notify the FAs of possible turbulence and suggested early compliance as a precaution. Both FAs did exactly as suggested by the FO immediately and were ready to be seated quite early, even with turbulence they were still in seat before sterile flight deck. As for acquiring witnesses and witness accounts unfortunately due to the timing of occurrence and the time FA-A became aware of said situation it was no longer an option to get said info. Additionally, based on evaluation following the incident, it is apparent FA-B was in shock and so it would be unrealistic to expect FA-B to have had the wherewithal to ask for witness info and/or for them to stay for a report.","","","","Air carrier Flight Attendant reported severe turbulence during descent resulting in injury to one of the flight attendants.","","",FALSE,FALSE

While on a base vector I noticed that neither of our ghost needles had popped up so I went heads down into the FMS to make sure the right approach was loaded. It was not so I began loading the ILS 19R during the high workload situation. The most current altitude clearance at that time was to 2800 feet which was the GS intercept altitude. At some point while loading the correct approach we were given a new clearance with an intercept heading of 220, maintain 2800 feet until established, cleared for the ILS 19R approach. Once established on final ATC reiterated to maintain 2800 feet at which point I looked at the altitude selector set to 2100 feet for unknown reasons. I replied to ATC that we were climbing back up to 2800 feet at which point he sent us over to tower.The deviation was brought to our attention when ATC repeated that our clearance was to maintain 2800 until established. At that point I looked at the altitude selector and saw the wrong altitude selected. The event occurred because I was fixing a mistake I made earlier in the flight, my first officer was task saturated, and we did not follow SOP for altitude changes and confirmation. I was not made aware or realized that he had selected a new altitude in the altitude selector. We climbed back up to our assigned altitude and continued the approach with no further issues. This could have been prevented had I not been distracted by the FMS and we had followed SOPs when selecting a new altitude.","","I was almost task saturated due to low experience level in light ice, turbulence, and full IMC approach together. Continuous changes of headings and altitudes brought me to incorrectly select 2100ft on the altitude selector. In the future I will overcome confusion by reinforcing altitude selections and confirmation procedures as stated in [company] manuals.The event occurred because PM had selected an incorrect approach early on during flight and was focusing on fixing it during final vectors moments of the approach. I was task saturated and incorrectly select wrong altitude without confirmation from PM as SOPs procedures require. After descent to 2100ft we realized it was a lower altitude than the minimums for the approach and climbed back up to 2800ft.

A cold front had passed through the night before, and the winds aloft were from the NW at about 15-20 kts. OAT was about 0 deg C. About 20 nm West, ATC flight following gave me the surface wind as 330@5G12, but noted that the information was about an hour old. ATC terminated flight following, and I began my descent and tuned in the ASOS to hear the winds were 320@7 kts, gusting to 15 kts. Hearing no traffic on the CTAF and seeing no other traffic, I decided to land on the most favorable runway, 35. I flew a close-in left downwind on 35 to visually check the wind sock and wind-t. They both verified that the wind was generally from the North-West, so I continued the left pattern to final for runway 35. A 2 mile final is recommended to avoid overflight of housing near the airport, so I had a long stable approach to touchdown.On final, I began a slight side slip to the left to counter the left crosswind I was experiencing (and that I had expected). I continued the slip until touchdown, where I performed a wheel landing. I had rolled for maybe 1 or 2 seconds on both mains, when I suddenly was hit by a gust from the left that initiated a veer to the left. I applied full right rudder and left aileron to counter, but my control inputs were not sufficient to get back to the centerline. I applied light brakes, but got off them when the nose dipped, and relied on rudder. As I neared the left edge of the runway, the right rudder input took effect and the aircraft began a right turn. Unfortunately, I had now over controlled and the aircraft continued into a tight right turn as the tail came around with the tailwheel now on the ground. I estimate my ground speed when the ground-loop started at about 30-40 mph. As the aircraft continued the right turn, the tail wheel unlocked and the turn tightened. The right wing lifted due to centripetal force from the turn and the wind (now out of the West) also picked it up enough so that the left wing tip drug on the runway over about a 10 to 15 foot arc. The aircraft ended up heading downwind on runway 35. After taxiing to the ramp and tying down, I observed the wind gusts shifting about 60 degrees from NNW to W periodically about every 5 minutes and then returning to NW after a about a minute. I observed 3 cycles of this gust behavior.","The reporter stated the left wing was damaged during the ground loop and will be repaired.","","","Cessna 170 pilot ground looped on landing in gusty wind conditions.

While in cruise, we were working our way around a line of ThunderStorm (TS). I was pilot flying and we deviated south to avoid two large cells. After deviating south, we were told to proceed direct CLEWS on the KLNDR2 RNAV arrival. We were beginning to turn back toward CLEWS when we thought we were clear of the weather. ATC confirmed this by instructing us that we should be able to turn back toward the intersection in about 2 minutes. As we came around the corner, we encountered a large buildup/cell that was not painting on our radar due to the shadow from the first storm and also was not reported by ATC when we were advised that our route looked clear. By the time we were able to clearly see it, there was no way to avoid it. I pulled the thrust back to idle in order to slow the aircraft below Turbulent Air penetration speed in a short distance, since we didn't have much room. As we got into the cell, we began getting large airspeed fluctuations, one of which resulted in the airspeed dropping very rapidly to about 180 KIAS. As the speed unwound, the Captain called it as I was already reaching for the thrust levers. I pushed them up to the detent, but by the time the engines started to spool, the Pitch Limit Indicator came down and the shaker activated for a brief moment prior to the airspeed starting to recover. The autopilot disconnected, and I pushed the nose down slightly to avoid the shaker/pusher and to help rebuild airspeed. It appeared to be a large downdraft that caused the speed to unwind that quickly. The speed was still hesitant to increase, so I pushed the thrust past the detent into TO-1. Once the speed started to stabilize, we brought the nose back up to a level pitch and recovered our altitude. We were somewhere between 350 and 355 when I saw the altitude reverse into a climb. ATC queried us and we notified them that we lost about 500 feet due to the turbulence and were recovering back to FL360.The stick shaker as a result of not adequately reacting to the airspeed loss caused a UAS in the stick shaker activation with moderate to severe turbulence.My experience level with flying through buildups at such high altitudes was also a factor as it took me a moment longer to process it than it should have, and that resulted in activation of the stick shaker. I also allowed the airspeed to build up slightly higher than may have been necessary due to my uncertainty about whether or not airspeed was sufficient to fully recover. I erred on the side of building up more airspeed as opposed to less.Be more cautious with airspeed deviations in the event you are not able to avoid a TS cell.","","","","EMB-145LR First Officer reported receiving a stick shaker after inadvertently entering a thunderstorm at FL360.","350, 355, 500, 36000","36000",TRUE,TRUE

But carriers and the FAA collectively fail to get out from among the trees and step back and look at the forest, or big picture.Safety is severely compromised when pilots are rushed through a fast paced course into a new, highly complex, and automation intensive aircraft, transitioning from steam gauges and cables, then relegating them to the back seat (FB) to 'watch' without 'doing' for years. Add to this an occasional assignment on reserve to the FO seat, place them in a situation of severe sleep deprivation that equates to being legally drunk, send them to arguably the most demanding environment in the international system with malfunctioning automation, turbulence, and where ATC issues clearance changes that would make a sim check feel like kindergarten, and you have the making of a forest fire. These are serious safety issues, they continue to exist, and speak to core issues which all the human factors classes and new FARs are not addressing.Avoiding this type of event, and others like it, requires policy changes. No amount of human factors pie charts, graphs or pep talks will change that the underlying premise that no one wants to step back and look at the big picture issues because changes will likely cost money.My suggestion, for starters, is to have newly qualified FOs (especially from the MD80) be assigned high density domestic legs for one or two months before going international and being relegated to the FB seat for years.

I was amazed at the amount of turbulence and lighting we experienced given the rather innocuous XM satellite picture at the time of the occurrence.","The reporter stated that the autopilot, which had remained engaged throughout the ordeal, was having difficulty flying the approach and was disconnected. The reporter also found the aircraft difficult to control but was able to continue to a safe landing. Post flight revealed the reported damage to the flight controls and also that the rudder cable had been completely sheared. The engine and propeller were also found to have damage requiring maintenance.","","","An Epic pilot reported refiling prior to departure to avoid severe weather over Mississippi. XM radar is used to navigate around the southern end of a line of thunderstorms, through weather that appeared as green and light green on the XM image. ZHU agreed that the intended route was good showing no severe weather. The weather turned out to be anything but benign with two separate periods of severe turbulence with lightning. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the incident and the reporter continued to his destination.","28000","28000",TRUE,TRUE

FA Y was about to leave the galley when the Captain instructed the crew to be seated via the Public Address (PA). I was putting the cart on the floor with FA Y's assistance when my thumb was caught. FA X and FA Y were kneeling near the floor when there was severe turbulence that took both feet from under me. Feet up, I landed with full force on my back. Mostly on left side. FA Y turned/twisted right foot. He was able to make it to 1 right jumpseat. FA Z, who sat at 1 left cross aisle jumpseat caught my head. I was still on the floor for a while because of the hard impact. I was told a passenger jumped to my assistance and was told to sit down. When I could move, I had assistance from FA Z into the 1 right cross aisle jumpseat. While waiting out the turbulence I started feeling numbness in my legs. When we could get up, my body was sore and aching. I attempted to continue service, but had movement problems. Bending, squatting, pulling, and reaching. I was sent to the bunk to recover. I did complete arrival service. Pain and stiffness on layover. Can sit for few minutes at a time. Neck pain and back spasms.

Both GPS's showed us approximately 2 miles outside the SFRA boundary. I was up on FDK tower frequency and just prior to contacting them to notify of our transition south of their airspace, the tower called and asked if the aircraft approximately 8 miles to their south east were up frequency. I responded and after letting them know who we were and where we were 'Aircraft X is Southeast, north of the DC ADIZ and south of the Class D', the tower asked what our destination was and I informed him. The tower then instructed us to contact Potomac Approach upon landing. After contacting Potomac Approach, I was informed that we had penetrated the boundary of the SFRA by 1-2 miles. We were flying at a low altitude to stay out of forecasted turbulence at higher altitudes and the poor radio reception with approach that we normally encounter in that area otherwise we would have been flight following at that time. I have been through that area several times but this is the first time I have had an issue. We were slightly closer to the boundary but as stated above, both aircraft were showing the same thing, just outside the boundary. I understand that regardless of what the equipment is reporting, it is the pilot's responsibility to follow the rules. It is my intent to keep a minimum of 5 miles distance in the future. Possibly a larger thicker boundary marking on the VFR sectional and TAC's that is actually a couple miles further than the actual boundary would help future penetrations.","","[Report narrative contained no additional information.]","","Flight of two helicopters with two GPS sources flew a course 2 miles outside the Washington DC SFRA, yet PCT TRACON claimed the aircraft was inside the SFRA by two miles.","","",FALSE,FALSE

Winds were 340/11G21. We were completing the last instrument approach as part of the IPC and finishing up for the day, planning to land full stop out of the ILS 6 at ABE. The distance from the runway end to the intersection with Runway 31 is not much more (possibly less than) 2,000 feet. During the approach we were given no Land and Hold Short (LAHSO) instruction, and had one been given I would have declined it as landing out of an ILS to minimums can require significant runway, very often requiring crossing Runway 31. The landing was challenging due to the gusty winds, and after landing and during rollout I was given a 'Hold Short of Runway 31 - landing traffic' instruction approximately 500 feet from Runway 31. As I looked to my right there was a King Air rotated and about to touch down on 31, and had we not been able to stop (or had to execute a late go-around), there could have been a serious incident. The controller clearly put himself in a bad situation and did not take steps to correct it in a timely manner.Fortunately the strong gusty winds that day allowed for a very short rollout in the Mooney and we were able to stop and make a turn prior to Runway 31, which is usually not the case when flying that approach.","","","","Mooney pilot reported a ground conflict after landing at ABE.

He's a great guy, but he's really behind the airplane. He's missing flows and very very slow on getting checklists done. I took this into consideration and always try to give him time. It just seems it's never enough. So, at the gate, I knew we were going to get Runway XYC to fly to airport ZZZ. I put in the numbers for XYC , XYC [intersection takeoff], and XYR. When we pushed off the gate, they told us to expect XYR. So, we changed everything and bugged it. We taxied out and contacted Ground. They told us to expect XYC now. So, we changed everything again and bugged XYC.We're taxing down Runway XX. I saw no line and I know he needed time. So, I asked for delayed engine start and we cranked engine #1. In my opinion, my FO just looks lost. And I'm trying to help him. This is day 2, leg 2 of 4. It's night, bad weather, etc.We turn on [the] Taxiway to head to XYC. I ask for 'Airport Runway XYC, flaps 8 taxi checklist'. He reads it to me, albeit very slow. Tower comes on and asks why we are taxing so slow. He's flustered. I say I'm giving my FO time to run a checklist. Tower instructs me to pull into XYC intersection taxiway to let a MedEvac airplane behind me takeoff.No problem, I do as I'm told and pull in to taxiway. So, now I ask him to bug those numbers! Because we have them. He's barely through before takeoff checks. We get those done and now were ready.What I failed to see XYC [intersection takeoff] was flaps 20. Not flaps 8. If I had made him read and do all the taxi checks over again, I guarantee I would have seen it. And I didn't. We did a normal takeoff. Got to 1,000 feet. Accelerated to 200 KTS. VT 10 I call for flaps up. Well, I glanced down and saw 20. I was sick to my stomach. I can't believe I made such an error. All I could think about was the CRJ -200 that went off the runway when was in ground school.That said, the airplane flew fine. We got it cleaned up. We flew to ZZZ as normal. Still, I'm not happy with what happened and want to admit to it. I have learned from this, that from now on, when ATC changes my runways 3 times and we're under pressure, I'm stopping that airplane and redoing the whole checklist over again. No question about it. Because if I had, I would of caught that.Lastly, my FO. As I stated earlier, he's a great guy, very nice, but he is behind that airplane. I almost feel at times I'm single pilot. Flying to ZZZ, he goes on this rant about '%^$% Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and #%@& Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA), changing runways is ##%' etc. I told him to calm down and not worry about it and I needed him to focus on flying the plane and helping me. I could tell this flustered him. He missed all his after takeoff flows even though I asked for them. I looked up and see a green light and I ask 'why is the APU still on?' I check Crew Alert System (CAS) and ask why the thrust reversers are still armed. He throws his hands up and says I'm not thinking right. I didn't yell or say anything. I just got the airplane configured correctly.So, we land in ZZZ and we still have to do one more ZZZ1 to ZZZ turn for the night. It's his leg to ZZZ1 and we're taxing out. He's not organized. He has no charts out. He's fumbling for them. He couldn't brief me. I look at him and ask if he's okay and if he wants me to fly the leg to ZZZ1 and back to ZZZ. He said he thinks that would be best. We flew (well, I was pilot flying) the last two legs without incident.I think it might be best for my FO to have a review or maybe some more training. I say it out of Safety. Not to be mean. The CRJ is a huge learning curve. I was there once myself, so, I get it.","","Taxiing to Runway XYC with the flaps set correctly at 8 degrees for XYC and while performing the before takeoff checklist Tower asked if we could turn onto XYC intersection taxiway in order to give way to a MedEvac aircraft taxiing behind us and accept a XYC intersection [takeoff] departure. After the Captain told the Tower we could, the MedEvac aircraft was given a takeoff clearance behind us from [a further down] XYC intersecting taxiway so in fact our intersection departure was no longer a necessity. Nevertheless, Captain turned onto [intersecting runway] and after stopping short of XYC changed the Automatic Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) takeoff data from XYC to XYC [intersection takeoff], informed me that he had bugged the speeds and asked me to finish the before takeoff checklist and call ready for takeoff. During the climb the Captain pointed to the ACARS and stated that we should have used flaps 20 instead of 8.","","CRJ-900 flight crew reported taking off with flaps set to 8 when they should have been set to 20, after several runway changes by ATC during taxi out. The Captain described the First Officer as being well behind the aircraft.","1000","1000",FALSE,FALSE
