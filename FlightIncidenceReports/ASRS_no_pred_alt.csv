"49","Enroute to SDF we were issued holding at OWB due to heavy thunderstorm activity at SDF. We were instructed to hold south of OWB on the 180 radial @ F240 with an EFC. We acknowledged the clearance and quickly programmed the FMS for the hold. A brief review of the holding page was accomplished and the hold was activated. The Second In Command (SIC) and I immediately began discussing options for a possible diversionary airport. In addition, we were busy with scrutinizing the radar picture to determine any weather that could impact our current holding situation, route to SDF, or route to diversionary airport. We entered holding at OWB and very quickly determined that the holding pattern we programmed was not correct. The incorrect holding pattern rendered us holding north with and inbound course of 180. We immediately recognized the incorrect programming and promptly notified ATC. We told the controller we would re-program the hold and re-enter the hold once we pass over OWB. He indicated that we were fine and we could remain in our current holding pattern. Approximately 20-25 minutes we advised ATC that our current holding pattern was placing us in close proximity to the encroaching severe weather and that we would like to hold on the south side as initially instructed. The controller complied with our request and issued new holding instructions. We entered the new hold and held for approximately an additional 15 minutes. After nearly 45 minutes of holding and no evidence of a pending approach clearance, we coordinated with company dispatch and other departments and diverted. At no point was there any conflict with ATC or the numerous aircraft operating/holding in the vicinity of OWB.I believe good CRM prevailed in this case. My SIC and I recognized the programming error and immediately notified ATC. There was some compression/haste in programming as we were close to the holding fix upon receiving our holding instructions.  In retrospect more time could have been spent during the confirmation and activation phase of programming. This will undoubtedly be the case moving forward. I believe fatigue partially contributed to the event, as it was after midnight and we had already completed 2 lengthy flights prior to this ferry. That in combination with the severe weather surrounding our position posed some great human factor challenges for us.","","24000",FALSE
"55","We were about 3 hours into our flight when the deviation occurred. Earlier in the flight we were encountering Mountain Wave and various levels of Turbulence over the Rockies and west of the Rockies.  We were given a Direct to BAM which we proceeded to fly.Sometime later we were given a Direct to SLOWN intersection, then Direct to BAM, on course.After a Frequency change, or two, we were informed by Salt Lake Center that GPS jamming was now in effect for our area.  We noticed shortly thereafter that our navigation was no longer a GPS, but now dead reckoning.  We already had the next VOR (BAM) in our radios, so we made sure we had a good identifier and proceeded direct to BAM.We forgot that our earlier clearance of direct BAM was superseded by the Direct SLOWN clearance.  We were in the middle of taking bathroom breaks when ATC advised us of being off-course.  The First Officer (FO) was flying at the time and flew the vector assigned. When I came back into the cockpit, the FO went back to use the restroom.  We were cleared back to BAM, we were fairly close to BAM at the time, with very strong winds out of the North our turn was going to overshoot our desired course, the controller gave us a heading direct to 'LLC when able'Losing our GPS function in the aircraft is not much of a problem, except when we are specifically flying direct to a fix.  Some of our airplanes have IRU's which is then no problem.  On this airplane, when it happens again, we should recheck our Situational Awareness, ask for vectors until we are assured of what course of action we will take.","","34000",FALSE
"73","We departed early hoping to beat strong thunderstorms moving into the entire area. We had to fly approximately 50-75 miles off our flight path due to weather. We descended through the layers of broken clouds in strong winds and severe turbulence. We radioed ZZZ several times with no response. We lined up on final for Runway 17 With a strong thunderstorm just to the South of the airport moving North quickly on 1/2 mile final for 17 we observed construction equipment on the runway. With the thunderstorm moving close and strong turbulence, I made an immediate decision to move to the left 50 or so feet and land on the taxiway. The taxiway was clear of any equipment and personnel and the landing was successful with no incidents.","","1340",FALSE
"74","On final approach to Bradley airport approx. 5 miles out, we hit severe turbulence and windshear that caused a major increase in airspeed, downdraft and a ground proximity warning.","","2500",FALSE
"75","I am the Captain and was Pilot Monitoring (PM). The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying. I called dispatch on Satcom enroute to get an update on weather on our route. The dispatcher mentioned a small speck of weather on the Sat IR approximately 150 miles ahead on our position. We already were looking at that on our radar and started a deviation to the west of course with ATC clearance about 80 miles away.Our current altitude was 39,000, the optimum altitude was 37,900. We were 1,000 above optimum but also 2,900 below Max (41,900). We had selected that altitude as the ride was not good at 35,000 and we were unable to get 37,000 approved earlier.The Weather was on the route at OPLIP intersection, and our Deviation was west of course 60 NM. Time was XA:40Z and we were talking with Amazonica Control. As we approached the cell (still approx. 40 miles off our left) the FO deviated even further to the west to give a wider berth. With the turbulence we had slowed to mach 82. We were about 20 knots above the yellow hook. VNAV was engaged and rather abruptly we both noticed a change in wind direction from a right cross wind of 30 to a headwind of 25. I noticed a sudden change in Total Air Temperature (TAT) temp warmer and then the Pitch Limit Indicators (PLI) displayed on the PFD about 1.5 degrees above our pitch attitude and the speed was decreasing, still above the yellow hook. Engine thrust was now at max Climb we both knew that we would not be able to maintain altitude. The FO asked me about a descent, I said yes descend immediately.I called once to ATC for a clearance and got no reply to our request. I declared a mayday and broadcast our intention to descend to 370. The FO selected 370 and pushed the altitude select button and turned the jet even further from the cell. I suggested a vertical speed descent rather than VNAV.I scanned the engine instruments and EICAS on the descent I notice the temp had gone from -18 to -3. Almost as quickly as we had lost speed in the descent we gained it, and quickly approached max airspeed or the red tape. The FO had his hands full selecting the heading sector and pulling the throttles back some. I used the speed brakes to aid the descent and control speed, after some variable movements in speed from the high to low (all still within the yellow and red bands) we leveled off and maintained 370.I explained our reason for the Mayday call to Amazonica control and got clearance to maintain 370. After passing the weather we were in the clear and returned to the track.We surmised that the temp change put the airplane in a coffin corner situation suddenly and once we got slightly behind the power curve, the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude.I've seen sudden changes in wind speed and direction around thunderstorms and also temps changes, but this was the most significant temp change I've witnessed. We gave this rapidly developing cell (with significant lightning during our passage) at least 20 miles clearance at all times and choose to fly upwind of the cell. But even that was not enough to avoid these atmospheric circumstances prompting our Mayday descent. The Mayday call was to warn ATC and other aircraft of the immediate situation, the outcome of which was never in doubt. [The other] FO was in the bunk and was briefed on the event after our crew change a short period later.Dispatch needs better weather tools for Thunderstorms in Latin South America. They often look at weather and think that not much weather exists and can offer no help to crews in real time. Often causing us to deviate far off course to avoid developing thunderstorms, such as this weather event. Also inflight weather charts and Radar for flight crews in a must in this modern era. Most GA aircraft have much better real time pics of the weather than a $300 M airline aircraft, using hours old paper charts and old electronic data from prior to block out! It's time for real time weather in our flight decks!","[Report Narrative Contained No Additional Information].","37000",FALSE
"94","I planned to fly from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. I had a passenger who is a friend recovering from prostate surgery. On takeoff I found that it was choppy so I spoke to my passenger on the intercom and we agreed it was not a good idea to fly 50 miles each way in the bumpy conditions because of his recent surgery. I called Lancaster ATC and asked for a left turn to head south east for a much shorter flight to Airport ZZZ for lunch. ZZZ1 ATC approved the request and no further communication was received from them. I flew the route using dead reckoning as it was a familiar route to me. At about 7NM from ZZZ I changed to the CTAF and at about 5NM I announced I was inbound to ZZZ from the West. I checked the AWOS and the wind favored runway XY. I announced left downwind to RWY XY and finals to land. No contact was made to me at any time by anyone at ZZZ. I landed, parked, and chocked the aircraft. At that time a woman from the FBO came up and asked me to call TRACON by telephone. I did so and was informed I had entered a TFR centered on Wilmington. I was asked for my details and I gave the information as requested. A few minutes later the Secret Service called me and asked for my full details which I supplied. I received two further calls from the Secret Service and was asked to remain at ZZZ pending an interview and I did so. Agent X and one other interviewed me and I answered all their questions. I consented to my Stearman being searched and photographed. I have reconstructed in my mind what happened and I have identified the error. I used Foreflight and ADDS (Aviation Digital Data Service) for flight planning, weather, and TFRs. I entered my route in Foreflight and there were no TFRs on the planned route. I have an e-mail conforming the entry from Foreflight. I changed my destination in flight and headed in an easterly direction unaware that there was a TFR which covered Airport ZZZ. I was over 20 miles from the center, in the outer ring, and did not cause any air traffic issues or hazard. I did not file a flight plan and I did not call enroute. It was my error, I researched the route but because I had not anticipated flying in the opposite direction I did not research the route I ended up taking. I did not use Foreflight for navigation itself. I will not rely on Foreflight for briefing in future and will obtain a briefing including a 360 degree overview to cover the possibility of a change in route. I had not considered this eventuality before when flight planning as we invariably ask for a briefing on the intended route of flight.","","2000",FALSE
"108","We had multiple small to medium size thunderstorms in the area departing LAS and encountered frequent light to moderate turbulence during our climb.  We were able to avoid most of the strong radar returns.  As we passed BTY we advised ATC that we needed to deviate West around weather ahead.  ATC advised us that if we could go North then we would avoid weather near OAL as well and would be clear past OAL.  We had just enough time to turn North and still avoid the weather.  I was insuring the Flight Attendants were still seated. I noticed that the First Officer was turning closer to the weather. When I realized that ATC had requested that the flight turn towards the weather I advised that we would be unable to do so. When told by ATC that there was a restricted area ahead, I [used captain's] and told ATC that we would not fly any further west and to contact the airspace authority for said restricted area.","","21000",FALSE
"114","Received clearance from LA Center to deviate for weather on ADDEL1 arrival into HND. ATC was very busy seemed to be operating three different frequencies (2 VHF and one UHF) at the same time. We were given clearance to deviate south of course and off the arrival for weather and before we were handed off to Las Vegas Approach we informed LA Center that we would have to slow down for turbulence.As we were deviating off course from the arrival and we had informed LA Center of the problem I thought there would be no issue with us slowing down for turbulence, but Las Vegas Approach felt we should have maintained 250 knots even though we were off the arrival course.As this speed in turbulence would compromise the safety of the Citation Bravo I was flying with the existing turbulence I flew a slower and safer speed (225 knots) south of the arrival corridor and clear of clouds on our arrival into Las Vegas.When we first came on frequency with Las Vegas approach I should have informed them of the fact that we were slower than the posted speed on the arrival due to turbulence in case the information was not passed on from LA Center.","","12000",FALSE
"138","The LCA captain and I (first leg of my IOE) had just returned from break and were briefed by the relief pilots that the turbulence we were in was being caused by the wake of a Super 380 in front of us which was further right of course than us with a right to left wind. The thought was to go further right to get behind him so we would be out of the wake, so we went R3 on the SLOP and did get out of the wake. We then received a message from ATC asking how far right we were and replied R3 and next message from ATC said R2 was max SLOP so we returned to R2 and sent a reply stating we were returning on course. By this time the Super in front of us was now left of track so we [were] out of his wake turbulence.","I normally use 1 NM and have never used more than 2. I have no excuse for thinking at that moment the limit is 3 NM. A short time later Brisbane asked how far right we were. We replied 3 NM. They advised the max is 2 and we immediately corrected to 2 NM and advised.","37000",FALSE
"142","Cruising at six thousand as assigned in IMC in relatively smooth air we encountered a large downdraft of building storm that was not on our NEXRAD as there was very little if any rain. ATC also did not advise of any condition such as this. Aircraft [was] put into 1,500 FPM dive and 50 degree bank. This upset the autopilot which we promptly disconnected. Upon recovery we were almost one thousand feet below assigned altitude. Advised ATC of the deviation and issued Pirep to ATC.","","6000",FALSE
"186","After pre-flight we discussed the maintenance issues, one of which was MEL 22-10-02 which is in reference to the 'heading bug' being inoperative with the autopilot. We discussed the MEL which stated that the aircraft was airworthy and capable of operating in RVSM and RNAV scenarios. During the flight we received clearance via the SOCKK TWO RNAV arrival. Before reaching GUTZZ intersection we received direct KIILO, and approximately 20 NM from KIILO we received a 'descend via' clearance for the SOCKK TWO arrival. Due to the speed restriction given to us of 270 and the late descend via clearance we determined that we 'might be a little high' at KIILO. I informed ATC (Fort Worth center) and we received clearance to be high at KIILO as long as we maintained 270 KTS. We maintained 270 and made the altitudes listed at KIILO. It is around this time that the Fort Worth center controller gave us a left turn for spacing. The captain then advised the controller of our current MEL and that we would have to disconnect the autopilot to make the turn, and therefore be unable to continue the RNAV arrival. The Fort Worth Controller then cleared us to stay on the arrival and maintain 230 KTS. We were then handed off the Regional Approach control. We checked in with Regional Approach control and were issued a speed reduction to 210 KTS, a descent to 6,000 MSL and a left turn. The captain then reiterated our MEL and that if we took the turn we would have to disconnect the autopilot and would be unable to continue the RNAV arrival. The controller acknowledged the issue, and issued the turn again, at which point we immediately disconnected the autopilot and made the turn to the assigned heading. Shortly after which the Regional Approach controller advised us of a 'Possible Pilot Deviation' and we copied a phone number down. We complied with each altitude and speed restriction given to us during the flight and landed the aircraft without further incident.I believe this was a miscommunication/ misunderstanding with Air Traffic Control and ourselves. Better communication of current aircraft operational limitations with Air Traffic Control, and possibly more understanding of company operational limitations by Air Traffic Control could easily prevent this situation from reoccurring.","WE were descending on the SOCKK2 into DFW and was cleared to KIILO intersection with altitude relief until BOOVE, but given 280 knots or less and was doing 270 knots. At some point around KYSSS intersection ATC asked us to make a left for spacing. My first officer initially responded 'unable'. I took the radio call and explained that we have an MEL that is operationally limiting the aircraft. Advised that we can take the turn, but that would require the autopilot to come off and then we would no longer be able to continue on the RNAV arrival. ATC then advised to stay on the SOCKK2 and slow to 230 knots and we complied. Next controller issued a left to us prior to BOOVE intersection. Advised controller of same issue and he stated he understood and needed the turn for spacing. Autopilot was turned off, made turn and continued with vectors. We were advised by ATC to copy a phone number for pilot deviation. Once at the gate, I called the number and was advised they will be investigating the incident. I stated my case with the person on the phone and asked for all tapes to be saved and a copy for myself. Was given a phone number to their Quality Assurance manager and told he would be in touch with me.This was due to a poor MEL. The write up was for the heading bug and the MEL was for flight director modes. Poor guidelines given on the MEL. Please refer to MEL 22-10-02. I did not know or understand what this MEL was actually referencing by the MEL itself. Once airborne we needed a vector for weather and put the aircraft in Heading mode and realized that the Heading bug was not functioning properly. We could not turn the aircraft to a specific head using the Heading bug. In no way did this MEL address this issue. Once on the ground I called MX and advised that this aircraft should not be flown until fixed and they agreed.","6000",FALSE
"200","Part 91 corporate flight back from eastern Washington to western Washington over the Cascade Mountains. Daylight departure, night arrival into MVFR/IFR conditions after a VMC descent into the terminal/approach area. Cleared direct to the IAF for an RNAV approach at destination, a transition and approach I have flown a couple dozen times in training and operationally. Entered IMC conditions with light icing and light turbulence just prior to the IAF. Was given a crossing restriction at the IAF and cleared for the approach; after passing the fix, noticed my position on my iPad depicted me well north of the desired transition course and deviating. As I started the turn to the right (east) to correct, noticed that I had misprogrammed the GPS (GNS 480) where the approach wasn't 'executed'. The GPS steering had me going to the airport rather than the next IF on the approach. As I attempted to reload and activate the approach while correcting back on course, broke out into night, visual conditions, announced as much to approach while requesting the visual and cancelled IFR. Landed uneventfully. (Approach never mentioned deviation and there was never any threat to terrain or other aircraft.) Lessons: don't take a milk run back to home base for granted. Light icing, rain and turbulence surprised me, as METAR and local TAFs showed only BKN layers and good vis. I had a good plan for the approach, but executed it very poorly, specifically with regards to GPS programming and confirmation of 'what is it doing next?' I have been flying several different type aircraft lately with different avionics and have to believe this contributed to my complacency and error. One of the dirty secrets of aviation is fatigue. I had brought these passengers out early that morning and sat all day at destination waiting for them. Of course they were well past the proposed departure time. Lesson: even though the schedule isn't known, you MUST grab some rest if you need it, especially with a return to IMC conditions and/or if you are fatigued. I definitely was tired looking back on the flight on the drive home. I had a supremely capable airplane, flying a well-known route and approach to my home airport, and I made a couple errors that could have compounded into something more serious like an official deviation or worse. Great lesson and won't happen again anytime soon.","","5000",FALSE
"210","I was the Pilot in Command (PIC) non flying pilot.  We were on the descent into Midway airport.  We were cleared from the FL's to 4,00 MSL with an altimeter setting of 30.36.  Reaching 4,000 we were questioned about our altitude, something about check your Mode C and altitude.  I stated we were level at 4,000 MSL, ATC stated they showed us at 3,000. I asked her to confirm the altimeter setting and was given a new setting of 29.44.

"225","After realizing electrical systems were failing with imminent loss of comms, transponder was squawked to reflect situation. Due turbulence during the turn back to departure airport and small size of the unit buttons, 7700 was initially entered. After shutting down entire electrical system and restarting with only radios, remaining battery power was sufficient to realize and correct squawk code to 7600. Communication with [ATC] center via relay with another flight inbound due to poor transmit power off batteries.Alternator circuit was found tripped upon landing, reset, and electrical system returned to normal, alternator was able to charge battery. Alternator fault was likely a result of overloading the circuit by turning on all aircraft lights during previous landing. Ammeter reading did not show a charge, but also no discharge during run up.Being a low hour pilot, prevention of this situation is obvious to inexperience. Familiarity with breaker panel would have likely allowed correction immediate without requiring to declare loss of comms. Knowing the load limits of the alternator would have prevented the circuit fault. Double checking transponder code would have prevented incorrect squawk code. Since this is a new aircraft to the pilot, further familiarization with systems is required. Paying closer attention to why a small indication is abnormal rather than expecting a failure to present in a specific fashion would prevent the larger failure or potential emergency.","","5500",FALSE

"241","Preflight forcast indicated numerous horizontal shears and areas of moderate turbulence across the Pacific.  Dispatch provided information available at the time.  Normally, I am able to get real-time graphic updates via aircraft WiFi, WSI updates on our iPad EFBs, and or ACARS Dispatch notes.  Today, as is becoming the norm, WiFi was inop on this aircraft.  Dispatch provided at least 5 turbulence advisories as we proceeded along [our] route of flight.  These advisories are generated by WSI and are in a format that includes 'boxes' delineated by points defined by Lat/Long and or by Fix/bearing/Dist.  This particular flight I received three moderate turbulence advisories issued almost simultaneously that included, between the three,  THIRTY-THREE fixes.  One advisory [used] 18 fixes to define the advisory area.  The fixes included a mix of Lat/Long and P/B/dist fixes.  It took an inordinant amount of time, and was a major distracting factor, to digest, plot, and react to the textual information provided by WSI.  The first issue was the sheer number of fixes.  I believe a useable 'Box' can be defined with 4-6 points.  WSI's attempt at accuracy is not a positive factor in the ultimate safety of the operation, because it requires much time to digest and plot, electronically on the map display, or on the paper plotting chart.  I actually was exiting an area of the turbulence advisory, before I realized it applied to my route of flight.  Another major issue with the useability of the fixes is that it is simply not possible to electronically depict more than two Fix/Bearing/Dist. points on the Map Display electronically.  I queried Our dispatcher and he expressed some mutual frustration in the format of the WSI advisories.  He even indicated that changes were requested from the dispatch end of the information flow - with no result.  This is my attempt to express 'End-User' frustration with the quality of these advisories.  I believe turbulence is one of the FAAs and the company's 'Hot Items'.  Let's get this fixed.","","31000",FALSE
"260","While flying to HWD airport, I was cleared to the initial approach fix for OAK and accepted the clearance incorrectly. This was due to similar sounding initial fixes for similar runways while flying in IMC with turbulence.While planning the flight from [departure airport] to Hayward (KHWD) I reviewed weather from multiple online sources as well as received a standard weather briefing via the Lockheed Martin Flight Services Garmin Pilot weather report. Weather at departure, enroute, and at the destination at the time of arrival was all forecast to be VFR.I departed and contacted departure and requested VFR flight following to HWD. While enroute we began to see some accumulating clouds. I began a decent [when] it appeared that we could maintain VFR below clouds up ahead. When it became clear that we would not be able to remain VFR below the clouds, I requested an IFR clearance and to climb above the clouds.I was cleared by Center direct to KARNN V301 SUNOL. When handed off to Nor Cal approach I requested the GPS RWY 28L approach and was given a 320 vector and told to descend to 6,000. I was expecting to be taken to JOBUS which has an initial approach altitude of 5,700. I was handed off to another Controller and told them that I was 'level 6,000, 320 heading, with [Hayward information ATIS code].' The controller told me to maintain 6,000 and that I was cleared direct JUPAP for the approach.While flying in IMC with slight to moderate turbulence, I activated the vector to final on my GPS and saw the localizer start to come in. I told the controller that I was established on the localizer and he responded 'Roger' and that he would clear me for the approach as I got closer to JUPAP.While re-reading the approach plate I did not see JUPAP on the plate. I switched back to IFR chart and began to look for both JOBUS and JUPAP. I could not find either. Soon after the controller came on to ask me if I was 'still heading to Hayward.' I responded that I was.Upon landing I realized that JUPAP is the initial fix for Oakland's GPS Runway 28L. The controller had been directing me to Oakland, not my destination of Hayward.This could have been avoided by me vocalizing my confusion and questioning the clearance to JUPAP. I should not have accepted a clearance to a fix I was not familiar with. Additionally, the controller should have noted that the information I provided was for Hayward. When I told him I was established that should have been another clue that I was not aligned for Oakland. Lastly, I do not believe similar runways, both are 28L, should have similar sounding initial fix names.","","6000",FALSE
